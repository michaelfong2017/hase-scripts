<tr><th colspan='3'>Case Summary:</th></tr><tr><td colspan='3'>On A/D, while having a vacation in the United Kingdom, VTM received a
message from WP1 via ""WhatsApp"" who claimed to be an investment expert.
Later, they continued to chat via ""WhatsApp"" and WP1 lured VTM to invest
in the US stock market via a bogus platform (deactivated). WP1 told VTM
that she could earn over HK$2,000,000 in the US stock market investment
within two months and claimed that he would manage the stock investment
for VTM. Feeling interested, VTM contacted the customer service of the
bogus platform (WP2), who provided 22 FPS accounts and two e-wallet
accounts to VTM. Later, VTM followed WP2's instructions and opened an
account on the bogus platform. Between 2024-12-30 and 2025-02-14, VTM
transferred a total of HK$ 1,856,610 (S/ppty1-24) to 22 FPS accounts and
two e-wallet accounts provided by WP2. Later, VTM failed to retrieve her
money and WP1-2 became out of reach. VTM has always surfed social media
(WhatsApp) and is unaware of the anti-deception campaign launched by the
Force.</td></tr>

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the "Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 ("AMLO"), which states that:-

*"An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*"Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. " (section 25(1))*

*\"Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP Cheung  ■■■■ ■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■
