ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486.

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents, we will follow the outlined steps to extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to the CSV records, and produce the consolidated JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. Here are the transactions listed:

1. **Date:** 2024-08-24, **Amount:** 50000 HKD
2. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 10000 HKD
3. **Date:** 2024-08-24, **Amount:** 31000 HKD
4. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 50000 HKD
5. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 60000 HKD
6. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 30000 HKD
7. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 39000 HKD
8. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 50000 HKD
9. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 50000 HKD

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match each transaction to the CSV records based on the date and amount.

#### Matching Results:

1. **Date:** 2024-08-24, **Amount:** 50000 HKD
   - **CSV Match:** `acee7754-75b4-444d-a9ed-f710c8fb1cd2`
   - **Transaction ID:** `acee7754-75b4-444d-a9ed-f710c8fb1cd2`

2. **Date:** 2024-08-25, **Amount:** 10000 HKD
   - **CSV Match:** `56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741`
   - **Transaction ID:** `56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741`

3. **Date:** 2024-08-24, **Amount:** 31000 HKD
   - **CSV Match:** `1e485d99-8478-482d-86fa-5d73f54d3347`
   - **Transaction ID:** `1e485d99-8478-482d-86fa-5d73f54d3347`

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, let's break down the task and follow each step carefully.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-10-07
- **Amount:** 192500 HKD
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Remitting Bank:** BOC (Bank of China)
- **Depositor Account No.:** 66666666601
- **Depositor Account Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HSB (Hang Seng Bank)
- **Beneficiary Account No.:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Account Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
  ""amount"": 192500,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""remitting_bank"": ""BOC"",
  ""depositor_account_no"": ""66666666601"",
  ""depositor_account_name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
  ""beneficiary_bank"": ""HSB"",
  ""beneficiary_account_no"": ""111-111111-101"",
  ""beneficiary_account_name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

CSV Record:
```csv
2024-10-07,HKD,192500,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited,66666666601,111-111111-101,YEUNG KAI,CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited    HK,192500,9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
```

Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-10-07
- **Amount:** 192500
- **Originator Account Number:** 66666666601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

This matches the extracted transaction perfectly. We use the Transaction ID from the CSV record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details:

- **Transaction ID:** 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
- **Originator Bank:** Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Cash Transaction Rules:
- Not applicable here since there is no mention of ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"".

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank:** Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **to.bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Social Media Deception
- **Police Reference:** ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)
- **Police Team:** E-HUB-■■■

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and matched data, we get the final JSON output:

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's go through the steps to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either originator/beneficiary account name or number.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 1
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Subject Type:** Beneficiary
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number:** 
- **Sending Bank Address:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited HK
- **Converted Amount:** 1
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

The CSV record matches the transaction details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:

- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel:** CWTF (mapped to FPS)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules:

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - `CWTF` → `FPS`

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV

}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD25,500.00
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account name, and bank.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Searching through the CSV file, we find the following matching transaction:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 25500
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

This transaction matches our criteria exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We now merge the data from the CSV transaction with the fraud alert source data.

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary:**

- **can_be_located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:

- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions:
1. **Date:** 2024-11-12
   - **Amount:** HKD50,000.00
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
   
2. **Date:** 2024-11-12
   - **Amount:** HKD56,000.00
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD50,000.00
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Exact match found in CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** ecd331fd-3f2b-48af-8102-36e9dd9ba457

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD56,000.00
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Exact match found in CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merging Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD50,000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction ID:** ecd331fd-3f2b-48af-8102-36e9dd9ba457
- **Channel:** CWTF (FPS)

#### Merging Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD56,000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction ID:** bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5
- **Channel:** CWTF (FPS)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: Always ""HSBC""
  - `to.bank`: Always ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules:**
  - CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions:
1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: `2024-11-12`
   - Amount: `93,000.00`
   - Currency: `HKD`
   - Originator Name: `MR CHAN TAI MAN`
   - Originator Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`
   - Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
   - Beneficiary Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: `2024-11-12`
   - Amount: `90,000.00`
   - Currency: `HKD`
   - Originator Name: `MR CHAN TAI MAN`
   - Originator Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`
   - Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
   - Beneficiary Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `93,000.00`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `MR CHAN TAI MAN`

Exact match found in CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** `d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7`

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `90,000.00`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `MR CHAN TAI MAN`

Exact match found in CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merging Transaction 1:
- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `93,000.00`
- **Currency:** `HKD`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Originator Bank:** `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `MR CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Beneficiary Bank:** `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **Transaction ID:** `d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7`
- **Channel:** `FPS` (based on `Transaction Type Source: CWTF`)
- **can_be_located:** `true`
- **transaction_references:** `[d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7]`

#### Merging Transaction 2:
- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `90,000.00`
- **Currency:** `HKD`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Originator Bank:** `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `MR CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Beneficiary Bank:** `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **Transaction ID:** `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`
- **Channel:** `FPS` (based on `Transaction Type Source: CWTF`)
- **can_be_located:** `true`
- **transaction_references:** `[1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628]`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: `HSBC`
  - `to.bank`: `HASE`

- **Channel Rules:**
  - `CWTF` → `FPS`

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract all transactions with both date and amount. Here are the transactions listed:

1. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD77,000.00
2. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD200,000.00
3. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD100,000.00

5. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD50,000.00
6. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD50,000.00
7. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD25,500.00
8. **Date:** 2024-11-12, **Amount:** HKD90,000.00
9. **Date:** 2024-11-11, **Amount:** HKD19,990.00

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data from the fraud alert source and the CSV records.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: Always ""HSBC""
  - `to.bank`: Always ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules:**
  - All transactions have the same description ""Default transaction"" and source ""CWTF"". According to the rules, this should map to ""FPS"".

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

This JSON output adheres to the provided schema and includes all required fields.",3963.0,4919.0
HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 16500.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account numbers, and names.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 16500.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN

After searching through the CSV file, we find the following matching transaction:

- **Transaction ID:** 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 16500
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV file, we merge the data as follows:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 16500.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - From Bank: HSBC
  - To Bank: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and merged data, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

HSBC Referral,7,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** HKD20,000
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV records based on the date, amount, and either originator/beneficiary account name or number.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** HKD20,000
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Checking the CSV records, there is no exact match for the originator account number and name combination. However, we can check for the beneficiary account number and name combination.

The closest match in the CSV is:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Originating Amount:** HKD10000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741

Since the amounts do not match exactly, we cannot use this transaction. Therefore, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we will fill in the necessary fields with the fraud alert source values and set `can_be_located` to `false`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No exact match was found, so we don't need to apply transaction rules here.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output based on the extracted and matched data:

```json

Police Letter,2,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** NA CASH

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""transferor_bank_and_account"": ""NA CASH""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

#### Extracted Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Transferor Bank and Account:** NA CASH

#### CSV Records:
1. **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
   - **Date:** 2024-08-29
   - **Amount:** 20000
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHUNG SIU

2. **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
   - **Date:** 2024-08-30
   - **Amount:** 20000
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
   - **Beneficiary Name:** (empty)

3. **Transaction ID:** 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
   - **Date:** 2024-08-28
   - **Amount:** 50000
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
   - **Beneficiary Name:** (empty)

**Exact Match Found:**
- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Name:** MR CHUNG SIU

Matched Transaction ID: `3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction ID, we merge the data from the CSV record:

- **Transaction ID:** 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Name:** (empty)
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

Since the originator bank is not specified in the CSV, we use the fraud alert source details:
- **Transferor Bank and Account:** NA CASH

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- Since the originator bank contains ""cash,"" set:
  - **channel:** ""cash""
  - **from.bank:** null
  - **from.name:** null

**Bank Rules:**
- **to.bank:** ""HASE""

**Channel Rules:**
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT → ""cash""

Final Merged Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MR CHUNG SIU"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""cash"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]
}
```

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document.
- Exclude police team information starting with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"".

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available.

From the source:
- **Police Reference:** TSW RN 240■■■■■■■
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and processed data, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Investment Scam"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSW RN 240■■■■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District"",

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we will follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transaction details are:

- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Cash Deposit

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-25"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""transferor_bank_and_account"": ""Cash Deposit""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Next, we need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### CSV Record:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2024-07-25,HKD,50000,C,,,,111-111111-101,,,Beneficiary,CCAS,CIF CASH DEPOSIT,,,50000,bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1
```

Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Transaction Code Description:** CIF CASH DEPOSIT

Since the transaction matches the criteria, we use the CSV transaction ID `bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We now merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

#### Merged Data:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-25"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""cash"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1""]
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the transaction rules:
- **Cash Transaction Rule:** Since the originator bank/account contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"", set `channel` to ""cash"".
- **Bank Rule:** Set `to.bank` to ""HASE"".

No changes needed here since the rules are already applied correctly.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extract global fields from the fraud alert source:
- **Fraud Type:** Romance Scam
- **Police Reference:** Policeref1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and processed data into the final JSON format:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Romance Scam"",
  ""police_reference"": ""Policeref1"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station"",

      ""amount"": 50000,

Police Letter,10,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we will follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transaction details are:

- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Heng Sang Bank 222-222222-101

Note: There seems to be a typo in the bank name ""Heng Sang Bank,"" which should likely be ""Hang Seng Bank.""

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-06-29"",
  ""amount"": 25500,
  ""transferor_bank_account"": ""Heng Sang Bank 222-222222-101""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

CSV Record:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2024-06-29,HKD,25500,C,,,222-222222-101,111-111111-101,CHEUNG TAK SHING,CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT,,,25500,82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9
```

Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

This matches our extracted transaction perfectly.

Matched Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-06-29"",
  ""amount"": 25500,
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9""]
}
```

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV record into the transaction object.

CSV Record Merged Fields:
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Transaction Type Source:** CUTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT
- **Converted Amount:** 25500
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

Merged Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-06-29"",
  ""amount"": 25500,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9""]
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules:
- **Channel Rule:** Based on the transaction code description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT,"" the channel is set to ""ATM.""
- **Bank Rule:** The beneficiary bank is set to ""HASE"" (Hang Seng Bank Ltd).

Final Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-06-29"",
  ""amount"": 25500,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9""]
}
```

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extracting global fields from the fraud alert source:
- **Fraud Type:** Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime
- **Police Reference:** Policeref1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

Final JSON Output:
```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"",
  ""police_reference"": ""Policeref1"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station"",

      ""date"": ""2024-06-29"",
      ""amount"": 25500,

Police Letter,12,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with extracting the transactions from the fraud alert source.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transactions are:

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Details:** CASH CASH

This transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount, so we include it.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction to Match:
- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Details:** CASH CASH

#### Matching Criteria:
- Exact match: Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Let's check the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
   - **Date:** 2024-07-17
   - **Amount:** 30000
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

2. **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
   - **Date:** 2024-07-17
   - **Amount:** 9000
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

3. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - **Date:** 2024-07-15
   - **Amount:** 40000
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

The transaction with **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f matches the criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** (Not provided in the source, set to null)
- **Originator Account Number:** (Not provided in the source, set to null)
- **Originator Bank:** (Not provided in the source, set to null)
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Cash (since the source mentions ""CASH CASH"")

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules:
- **Channel:** Since the source mentions ""CASH CASH"", the channel is ""cash"".
- **Originator Bank:** Set to null.
- **Originator Name:** Set to null.
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Always ""HASE"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extracting global fields:
- **Fraud Type:** Personal Data
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and processed data, the final JSON output is:

Police Letter,12,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with extracting the transactions from the fraud alert source.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transactions are:

- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Details:** CASH CASH

This transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount, so we include it.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction to Match:
- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000

#### Matching Criteria:
- Exact match: Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Let's check the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - **Date:** 2024-07-15
   - **Amount:** 40000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

This transaction matches the extracted transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

#### Merged Data:
- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 222-222222-101
  - **Bank:** (Not applicable, as it's a cash transaction)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Cash (since the transaction code description indicates a cash deposit)
- **Transaction References:** [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the transaction rules:

- **Cash Transaction Rule:** Since the originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"", set `channel` to ""cash"".
- **Bank Rule:** `from.bank` is null because it's a cash transaction. `to.bank` is ""HASE"".
- **Channel Rule:** The transaction code description ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" sets the channel to ""cash"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extracting global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type:** Employment Fraud (based on the checkbox in the source)
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF2 (excluding ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" information)
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

However, I can still demonstrate the process based on the given fraud alert source and a hypothetical set of transaction records.

Let's assume we have the following transaction records in the CSV file:

```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
The fraud alert source does not mention specific transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we cannot extract any transactions from this source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We need to extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception
- **Police Reference**: KTRN230■■■■
- **Writ No**: 8■■■
- **Contact Person**: PC 1■■■■
- **Police Team**: Detective Police Constable 15■■■ CHENG ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Since no transactions were extracted, the `alerted_transactions` array will be empty.

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""police_reference"": ""KTRN230■■■■"",
  ""writ_no"": ""8■■■"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC 1■■■■"",

If you provide the actual transaction records in the CSV file, I can perform the matching and consolidation steps accordingly.",2116.0,783.0
Search Warrant,7,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Given that there are no transactions in the fraud alert source, we will focus on the transaction in the CSV file and see if it matches the context provided in the fraud alert source.

#### CSV Transaction:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 25900
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Sending Bank Address:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Converted Amount:** 25900
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
We need to apply the bank and channel rules to the transaction.

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank:** The originator's bank is The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.
- **to.bank:** The beneficiary's bank is Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We need to extract and apply the global fields from the fraud alert source.

#### Fraud Type:
- The fraud type mentioned in the source is ""Obtaining Property By Deception"". According to the rules, we should look for other fraud type hints, but none are provided, so we use ""Not provided"".

#### Police Reference:
- The police reference is ""TSWRN240■■■■"".

#### Police Team:
- The police team is ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District"".

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Now, let's build the final JSON output based on the extracted and matched data.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSWRN240■■■■"",
  ""writ_no"": ""TM12■■■/2024"",

```

This JSON output follows the specified schema and includes all required fields based on the provided data and rules.",2270.0,908.0
UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 29-August-2024
   - Amount: HKD 20000
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 30-August-2024
   - Amount: HKD 20000
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** HKD 20000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found a match: `Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab`

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** HKD 20000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found a match: `Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** HKD 20000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator name)
  - Account Number: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator account number)
  - Bank: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator bank information)
- **To:**
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE (Based on the source file)
- **Channel:** ATM (Based on the description in the CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** null (No cancellation amount specified in the source)
- **Transaction References:** [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** HKD 20000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator name)
  - Account Number: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator account number)
  - Bank: Not Provided (CSV does not provide originator bank information)
- **To:**
  - Name: MR CHUNG SIU
  - Account Number: 111-111111-102
  - Bank: HASE (Based on the source file)
- **Channel:** ATM (Based on the description in the CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** null (No cancellation amount specified in the source)
- **Transaction References:** [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:**
  - From the source: External Fraud
  - Since it matches one of the specified types (""External Fraud""), we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - For both transactions, the beneficiary bank is HASE.

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Both transactions are categorized as ""ATM"" based on the CSV description.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 10 July 2024
- **Amount**: HKD 1.00
- **Details**: FPS Payment

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-10"",
  ""amount"": 1,
  ""currency"": ""HKD""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 1
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Transaction ID**: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

Match found:
- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS

Using the transaction ID `b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data:
- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Transaction ID**: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
- **Transaction References**: [b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d]
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 1 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank**: HSBC
- **to.bank**: HASE

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-07-10"",
      ""amount"": 1,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""MISS YEUNG KAI"",
        ""account_number"": ""666-66666-601"",
        ""bank"": ""HSBC""
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS"",
        ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""
      },
      ""channel"": ""FPS"",
      ""can_be_located"": true,
      ""cancel_amount_requested"": 1,
      ""transaction_references"": [""b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d""]
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output strictly follows the provided schema and includes all required fields.",3216.0,1064.0
UAR,5,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 12NOV24
- **Amount**: HKD25,500.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Remitting Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Request to Cancel Amount**: HKD25,381.00

We trim the leading and trailing whitespace from each field value:

- **Date**: 12NOV24
- **Amount**: 25500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Remitting Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Next, we match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date**: 12NOV24 (which translates to 2024-11-12)
- **Amount**: 25500
- **Beneficiary Account Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

We search for an exact match in the CSV records:

```csv
2024-11-12,HKD,25500,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK,25500,1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
```

This record matches the extracted transaction details. We use the Transaction ID `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We merge the data from the CSV record with the fraud alert source:

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 25500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381
- **Transaction References**: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From.Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. → HASE
- **To.Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. → HASE
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the outlined steps, we'll start by extracting the relevant transactions from the fraud alert source and then match them to the CSV records. Let's go through the steps one by one.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 12NOV2024
- **Amount**: HKD77,000.00
- **Description**: FPS PAYMENT

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",
  ""amount"": 77000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the extracted transaction based on the date and amount.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 77000
- **Originator/Beneficiary Account/Name**: CHAN TAI MAN

Searching the CSV for the transaction:
```csv
2024-11-12,HKD,77000,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK,77000,c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432
```

This transaction matches our criteria. We will use the transaction ID `c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we will merge the data as follows:

#### Extracted Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",
  ""amount"": 77000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD""
}
```

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction ID**: `c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432`
- **Originator**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Beneficiary Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited HK
- **Converted Amount**: 77000

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- From the fraud alert source, the fraud type is ""External Fraud"".
- No additional hints are provided, so we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC"")
- **to.bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (always ""HASE"")

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF -> ""FPS""

#### Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:
- The fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount of HKD20,000.00.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 19990.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Remitting Bank Cable**: The below cable message from HSBCH■■■: :20:HK124■■■■■■■-■■■■■■■ :21:HC124B110■■■■■■■ :79:RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 11NOV24 FOR HKD19,990.00 FPS REF NO.

IN REPLY, PLS QUOTE OUR REF HK124■■■■■■■-■■■■■■■ IN FIELD 21 OF YOUR SWF MSG REGARDS -
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 19990.00 (as per the cable message)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 19990.00
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN

Matching this to the CSV records, we find an exact match:

- **Transaction ID**: 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:

- **Transaction ID**: 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7
- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 19990.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS (based on Transaction Source in CSV)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 19990.00

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4)
  - **To Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - **CWTF** → FPS

- **Cancel Amount Requested**:
  - Specified in the fraud alert source: 19990.00

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-11"",

      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {

UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""

    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the outlined steps, we'll start by extracting the relevant transactions from the fraud alert source, then match them to the CSV records, and finally consolidate the data into the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following information:
- **Date**: Not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context to be around the time of the submission.
- **Amount**: HKD 130,000
- **Currency**: HKD

Since the exact date is not provided, we will assume the transaction date based on the CSV record date (2024-10-07).

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
  ""amount"": 130000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now need to match this transaction to the CSV record:
- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-10-07
  - **Originating Amount**: 192500
  - **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI

Given the extracted transaction:
- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 130000
- **Currency**: HKD

We look for an exact match in the CSV:
- **Exact match criteria**: Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

There is no exact match for the amount 130000 in the CSV record. However, we can still try to find a partial match based on the names and dates.

Since there is no exact match, we set:
```json
{
  ""can_be_located"": false,
  ""transaction_references"": []
}
```

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there is no exact match, we will fill in the fields based on the fraud alert source and the CSV record where applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type Rules**:
- Given the fraud type is ""External Fraud"", we will use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules**:
- **from.bank**: Based on the originator bank raw in the CSV, it is ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" which maps to ""HASE"".
- **to.bank**: Always ""HASE"".

**Channel Rules**:
- Since there is no exact match, we cannot determine the channel from the CSV record.

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**:
- No cancellation amount is specified in the fraud alert source, so `cancel_amount_requested` is set to `null`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
      ""amount"": 130000,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
        ""account_number"": null,

        ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",

      },
      ""channel"": null,
      ""can_be_located"": false,
      ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
      ""transaction_references"": []
    }
  ]
}
```

UAR,13,13,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV file, then consolidate the data into the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 21-Aug-2024
- **Amount**: HKD1244
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: Mr Cheung
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to match the extracted transaction to the CSV records. The CSV contains the following transaction:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 1244
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-08-21 (matches 21-Aug-2024)
- **Amount**: 1244 (matches HKD1244)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101 (matches)

Since the criteria are met, we use the transaction ID from the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Extract the transaction references and merge the data:
- **Transaction References**: [840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719]
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Transaction Type Source**: CUTF
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT
- **Channel**: ATM (based on the description)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type Rules**:
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the source)
- Since it matches one of the specified types (""External Fraud""), we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules**:
- **from.bank**: Based on the originator account number (222-222222-101), we don't have a direct mapping, so we'll leave it as null.
- **to.bank**: Always ""HASE"" based on the source.

**Channel Rules**:
- **Channel**: ATM (based on the description)

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**:
- No cancellation amount or request is specified, so `cancel_amount_requested` is null.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 08NOV24
- **Amount**: HKD25,900.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: HKD17,833.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Originating Currency**: HKD
  - **Originating Amount**: 25900
  - **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
  - **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Subject Type**: Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
  - **Sending Bank Account Number**: 
  - **Sending Bank Address**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Converted Amount**: 25900
  - **Transaction ID**: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

The transaction matches the extracted details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We merge the data from the CSV record into the extracted transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: 25900
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 17833
- **Transaction References**: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: HSBC
- **To Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS (based on Transaction Type Source CWTF)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with extracting the relevant transactions from the fraud alert source and then matching them to the CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, there is no explicit mention of specific transactions with both date and amount. However, based on the context, we can infer that the total loss amount is HKD30,000.00, and it occurred on 2024-07-17. Therefore, we will extract this transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-07-17
- **Amount**: 30000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**: CHEUNG TAK SHING (Victim)
- **To**: CHAN TAI MAN (Suspect)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the date 2024-07-17 and amount 30000 in the CSV records.

#### Matching Process:
- **Exact Match**: We look for a transaction with the exact date and amount.
- **CSV Record**: 
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-07-17
  - **Originating Amount**: 30000
  - **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN

This matches the first record in the CSV:

```csv
2024-07-17,HKD,30000,C,,,222-222222-101,111-111111-101,CHEUNG TAK SHING,CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT,,,30000,2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
```

- **Transaction ID**: 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We now merge the data from the CSV record into the extracted transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-07-17
- **Amount**: 30000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number**: 222-222222-101
  - **Bank**: HASE (Victim)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: HASE (Suspect)
- **Channel**: ATM (Based on Transaction Code Description: ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""Impersonation"". Since ""Impersonation"" is not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we use the value from the fraud alert source.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - From Bank: HASE (Victim)
  - To Bank: HASE (Suspect)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - Based on Transaction Code Description: ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

ODFT,20,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant information is:

- **Date**: 10DEC and 11DEC
- **Amount**: HKD46,000.00

We need to convert these dates into the format `YYYY-MM-DD`:
- 10DEC -> 2024-12-10
- 11DEC -> 2024-12-11

So, the extracted transactions are:
1. **Date**: 2024-12-10, **Amount**: 46000, **Currency**: HKD
2. **Date**: 2024-12-11, **Amount**: 46000, **Currency**: HKD

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2024-12-10, 46000, HKD
- **Exact Match**: 
  - **CSV Record**: 
    - **Date**: 2024-12-10
    - **Amount**: 46000
    - **Originator Account Number**: 222-222222-101
    - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 333-333333-102
    - **Originator Name**: (empty)
    - **Beneficiary Name**: CHUNG SIU
    - **Transaction ID**: 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66
  - **Match Found**: Exact match found.

#### Transaction 2: 2024-12-11, 46000, HKD
- **Exact Match**: 
  - **CSV Record**: 
    - **Date**: 2024-12-11
    - **Amount**: 46000
    - **Originator Account Number**: 222-222222-101
    - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
    - **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
    - **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN, TAIMAN
    - **Transaction ID**: dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda
  - **Match Found**: Exact match found.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-12-10, 46000, HKD
- **Transaction References**: [6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66]
- **From**: 
  - **Name**: (empty)
  - **Account Number**: 222-222222-101
  - **Bank**: HASE (since it's the victim's account)
- **To**: 
  - **Name**: CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-102
  - **Bank**: (unknown, but not HASE)
- **Channel**: ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

#### Transaction 2: 2024-12-11, 46000, HKD
- **Transaction References**: [dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda]
- **From**: 
  - **Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number**: 222-222222-101
  - **Bank**: HASE (since it's the victim's account)
- **To**: 
  - **Name**: CHAN, TAIMAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: (unknown, but not HASE)
- **Channel**: ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: 
  - From the source, the fraud type is ""Impersonation"".
  - Since ""Impersonation"" is not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we use the value from the source.
  - **Fraud Type**: Impersonation

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - For both transactions, the originator's bank is HASE.
  - The beneficiary's bank is unknown but not HASE.

- **Channel Rules**:
  - Both transactions have the description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" and ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", which map to ""ATM"".

  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **C RN 3547 (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Should you have any enquiry, please feel free to contact the undersigned or our officers at 286■■■■■. Thank you!

ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-01-20** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **STRN4150 (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-01-20
- **Amount:** 114104 HKD
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Remitting Bank:** BOC (Bank of China)
- **Depositor Account No.:** 59407816184
- **Depositor Account Name:** ZHAO WEI HONG
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HSB (Hang Seng Bank)
- **Beneficiary Account No.:** 949-759176-733
- **Beneficiary Account Name:** TANG SIU KWAN

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-01-20"",
  ""amount"": 114104,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""ZHAO WEI HONG"",
    ""account_number"": ""59407816184"",
    ""bank"": ""BOC""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""TANG SIU KWAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""949-759176-733"",
    ""bank"": ""HSB""
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

CSV Record:
```csv

- Not applicable here since there is no mention of ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"".

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank:** Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **to.bank:** HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

HSBC Referral,1803,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO TAI KEUNG
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Account Number:** Placeholder (not provided)

Since the originator account number is not provided, we will proceed with the available details.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either the originator/beneficiary account name or number.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 1
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 225-26771-196
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 844-392003-248
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr HO TAI KEUNG AND OTHERS
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

This record matches the transaction details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data from the CSV record into the extracted transaction details.

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN (from source)
- **Originator Account Number:** 225-26771-196 (from CSV)
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (from source)
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO TAI KEUNG (from source)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 844-392003-248 (from CSV)
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (from source)
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d (from CSV)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:

- **from.bank:** HSBC (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
- **to.bank:** HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- **channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we build the JSON output according to the schema:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""UAP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

Grand Total: 58 replacements","Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Currency:** HKD (inferred from the context)
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** NIL (not provided)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account name, and bank.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR HO WING KEI (CSV format)

Matching the transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR HO WING KEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 246-495796-850

This transaction matches our criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We now merge the data from the CSV and the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 246-495796-850
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Transaction ID:** `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules:
- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE
- **Channel Rules:**
  - Since the transaction type is ""Default transaction"" and the source is CWTF, the channel is FPS.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure compliance with the specified schema and requirements.",3963.0,5832.0
HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 11114
- **Currency:** HKD (inferred from context)
- **Originator Account Number:** 111-515645-952
- **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 533-812930-996
- **Beneficiary Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account numbers, and names.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 11114
- **Originator Account Number:** 111-515645-952
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 533-812930-996
- **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR TSANG MEI LIN (trimmed spaces)

Matching the above criteria, we find the following transaction in the CSV file:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 11114
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 111-515645-952
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 533-812930-996
- **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR TSANG MEI LIN
- **Transaction ID:** 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f

This transaction matches all the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV file, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 11114
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator:**
  - **Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Account Number:** 111-515645-952
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary:**
  - **Name:** MR TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Account Number:** 533-812930-996
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Transaction References:** [98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f]
- **Can Be Located:** true

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules:
- **Channel:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Grand Total: 25 replacements","To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: 19086
- **Currency**: Not explicitly mentioned, but based on context, it is likely HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 498-43624-186
- **Originator Name**: LAM SIU FUNG
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 228-879233-316
- **Beneficiary Name**: TSUI SIU KWAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

We now have one transaction to extract:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-25"",
  ""amount"": 19086,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""originator_account_number"": ""498-43624-186"",
  ""originator_name"": ""LAM SIU FUNG"",
  ""originator_bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"",
  ""beneficiary_account_number"": ""228-879233-316"",
  ""beneficiary_name"": ""TSUI SIU KWAN"",
  ""beneficiary_bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Next, we need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: 19086
- **Originator Account Number**: 498-43624-186 (or Originator Name: LAM SIU FUNG)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 228-879233-316 (or Beneficiary Name: TSUI SIU KWAN)

Let's check the CSV records for a match:

```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
...
2024-08-25,HKD,10000,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,444-4444444-101,228-879233-316,CHEUNG TAK SHING,TSUI SIU KWAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,10000,56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741
...
```

None of the transactions in the CSV match the exact date, amount, and account numbers provided in the fraud alert source. Therefore, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to an empty array.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there is no exact match, we fill in the necessary fields with the fraud alert source values and apply the required rules.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Given the lack of a match, we still need to apply the bank and channel rules:

- **Bank Rules**:
  - `from.bank`: Always ""HSBC""
  - `to.bank`: Always ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules**:
  - Since there is no matching transaction, we cannot infer the channel directly from the CSV. We will leave it as `null`.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we build the JSON output based on the extracted and matched data:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""reported by HSBC customer"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-25"",

      },
      ""channel"": null,
      ""can_be_located"": false,
      ""transaction_references"": []

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 22684
- **Currency:** HKD (inferred from context)
- **Originator:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 508-995304-174
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 328-507081-995
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either originator or beneficiary details.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 22684
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 508-995304-174
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 328-507081-995
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHEUNG WEI MING
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

This CSV record matches the transaction details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 22684
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 508-995304-174
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary:**
  - **Name:** MR CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 328-507081-995
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction References:** [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]
- **can_be_located:** true

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:

- **from.bank:** HSBC (since The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited is HSBC)
- **to.bank:** HASE (since Hang Seng Bank Ltd. is HASE)
- **channel:** FPS (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transactions are:

- **Date:** 2024-05-07
- **Amount:** 27694
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** NA CASH

So, the extracted transaction is:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-05-07"",
  ""amount"": 27694,
  ""transferor_bank_and_account"": ""NA CASH""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Exact match:** Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Let's check the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
   - **Date:** 2024-08-29
   - **Amount:** 20000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR LAU CHI MING

2. **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
   - **Date:** 2024-08-30
   - **Amount:** 20000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 440-183579-148
   - **Originator Name:** MR LAU CHI MING
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR LAU CHI MING

3. **Transaction ID:** 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
   - **Date:** 2024-05-07
   - **Amount:** 27694
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 440-183579-148
   - **Originator Name:** MR LAU CHI MING
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR LAU CHI MING

The transaction with **Date:** 2024-05-07 and **Amount:** 27694 matches the third CSV record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For the matched transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- **Date:** 2024-05-07
- **Amount:** 27694
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 440-183579-148
- **Originator Name:** MR LAU CHI MING
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR LAU CHI MING
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

Since the originator bank/account is ""NA CASH,"" we apply the Cash Transaction Rules:
- **Channel:** ""cash""
- **from.bank:** null
- **from.name:** null

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **from.name:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **to.bank:** ""HASE""
- **channel:** ""cash""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Personal Data
- **Police Reference:** Not explicitly provided in the source
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Personal Data"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-05-07"",
      ""amount"": 27694,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": null,
        ""account_number"": null,
        ""bank"": null
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""MR LAU CHI MING"",
        ""account_number"": ""440-183579-148"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""
      },

      ""can_be_located"": true,
      ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV

- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""

Grand Total: 14 replacements","To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we will follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's break down the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transaction details are:

- **Date:** 2023-09-15
- **Amount:** 47347
- **Description:** Cash Deposit

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2023-09-15"",
  ""amount"": 47347,
  ""description"": ""Cash Deposit""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Next, we will match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### CSV Record:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2023-09-15,HKD,47347,C,,,,782-590061-227,,,Beneficiary,CCAS,CIF CASH DEPOSIT,,,47347,bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1
```

Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2023-09-15
- **Amount:** 47347
- **Originator Account Number:** 782-590061-227

This matches the extracted transaction perfectly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we will merge the data:

- **Transaction ID:** bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1
- **Originator Account Number:** 782-590061-227
- **Originator Name:** Poon Ka Wai (from the fraud alert source)
- **Transaction Code Description:** CIF CASH DEPOSIT

Applying the rules:
- **Channel:** ""cash"" (since the description is ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"")
- **From Bank:** null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **To Bank:** ""HASE"" (as per the rules)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **To Bank:** ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""cash""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extracting global fields from the fraud alert source:
- **Fraud Type:** Romance Scam
- **Police Reference:** Not explicitly provided in the source
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and merged data, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Romance Scam"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

      ""date"": ""2023-09-15"",
      ""amount"": 47347,

      ""can_be_located"": true,
      ""transaction_references"": [""bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1""]
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the provided schema and includes all necessary fields.",2578.0,929.0
Police Letter,2560,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2561,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount.

Extracted transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Amount:** 38186
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Heng Sang Bank 903-280481-143

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We will now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Amount:** 38186
- **Originator Account Number:** 903-280481-143
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 361-740216-723

CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Originating Amount:** 38186
- **Originator Account Number:** 903-280481-143
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 361-740216-723

This matches the extracted transaction perfectly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

#### Merged Data:
- **Date:** 2025-05-13
- **Amount:** 38186
- **Currency:** HKD (extracted from CSV)
- **From:**
  - **Name:** WU CHI WAI
  - **Account Number:** 903-280481-143
  - **Bank:** Heng Sang Bank (extracted from source)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** LIU MING FUNG
  - **Account Number:** 361-740216-723
  - **Bank:** HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel:** ATM (based on Transaction Code Description in CSV)
- **can_be_located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **From Bank:** Heng Sang Bank (directly mentioned in the source)
- **To Bank:** HASE (rule-based)
- **Channel:** ATM (based on Transaction Code Description in CSV)

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime (extracted from source)
- **Police Reference:** None (no specific police reference mentioned)
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the extracted and merged data, we get the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station"",

Transactions: 10 total replacements
Ground Truth: 5 total replacements
Grand Total: 20 replacements","To process the given documents according to the specified steps, we'll follow the outlined procedure carefully. Let's start with extracting the transactions from the fraud alert source.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transaction details are:

- **Date:** 2025-03-21
- **Amount:** 11895
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** CASH CASH

This transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount, so we include it.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Extracted Transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-03-21
- **Amount:** 11895
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** CASH CASH

#### Matching to CSV Records:
- **CSV Record 1:**
  - **Date:** 2025-03-21
  - **Amount:** 11895
  - **Beneficiary Name:** YEUNG HOI SHAN
  - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

This matches our extracted transaction exactly (same date and amount). We use the transaction ID `40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

#### Merged Data:
- **Date:** 2025-03-21
- **Amount:** 11895
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CASH CASH (since it's a cash transaction)
  - **Account Number:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
  - **Bank:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number:** 504-921376-720
  - **Bank:** HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel:** cash (based on the transaction code description)
- **Can_be_located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

We apply the transaction rules to ensure consistency and accuracy.

- **From Bank:** Since the originator is ""CASH CASH,"" we set `from.bank` to null.
- **From Name:** Since the originator is ""CASH CASH,"" we set `from.name` to null.
- **To Bank:** Set to ""HASE.""
- **Channel:** Set to ""cash.""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extract the global fields from the fraud alert source.

- **Fraud Type:** Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime
- **Police Reference:** TSWRN9074
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Finally, we build the final JSON output based on the processed data.

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSWRN9074"",

Police Letter,2562,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Grand Total: 19 replacements","To process the given documents, we will follow the step-by-step approach outlined in the instructions. Let's start with extracting the transactions from the fraud alert source.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions that have both a date and an amount. The relevant transactions are:

- **Date:** 2023-09-20
- **Amount:** 27947
- **Details:** CASH CASH

This transaction is the only one that meets the criteria.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now need to match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Exact Match:** Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Let's check the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
   - **Date:** 2024-07-17
   - **Amount:** 30000
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU KA YAN
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 549-818437-223

2. **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
   - **Date:** 2024-07-17
   - **Amount:** 9000
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU KA YAN
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 549-818437-223

3. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - **Date:** 2023-09-20
   - **Amount:** 27947
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU KA YAN
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 549-818437-223

The third transaction matches the date and amount exactly, and the beneficiary details match as well.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For the matched transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
- **Date:** 2023-09-20
- **Amount:** 27947
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU KA YAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 549-818437-223
- **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)
- **Transaction Type Source:** CCCS

Using the fraud alert source:
- **From Bank:** Cash (since it's a cash deposit)
- **From Name:** Null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **To Bank:** HASE (as per the rule)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** Since the transaction code description is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"", the channel is ""cash"".
- **From Bank:** Null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **From Name:** Null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **To Bank:** HASE

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Employment Fraud (from the fraud alert source)
- **Police Reference:** None specified in the source
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Employment Fraud"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station"",

- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Grand Total: 6 replacements","It appears that the provided `TRANSACTION_RECORDS_CSV` does not contain any actual transaction records, which makes it impossible to perform the matching and consolidation steps. However, I can still demonstrate the process based on the provided fraud alert source and a hypothetical set of transaction records.

Let's assume we have the following hypothetical transaction records in the CSV format:

```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

```

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
The fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, there are no transactions to extract from the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since there are no transactions to extract from the source, there are no transactions to match to the CSV records.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Since there are no transactions to match, there is no data to merge.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
No transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We can extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception
- **Police Reference**: HH RN 4568
- **Writ No**: 0118099
- **Contact Person**: PC7660
- **Police Team**: Detective Police Constable 15■■■ CHENG ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Given that there are no transactions to include, the final JSON will only contain the global fields:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""HH RN 4568"",
  ""writ_no"": ""0118099"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC7660"",
  ""police_team"": ""Detective Police Constable 15■■■ CHENG ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

If you provide actual transaction records in the CSV, I can perform the full processing steps and generate the consolidated JSON output accordingly.",2115.0,821.0
Search Warrant,3307,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the given fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions mentioned with both date and amount. Therefore, we move to the next step.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since no transactions were extracted from the fraud alert source, we need to identify transactions from the CSV that could potentially be related based on the context provided in the fraud alert source.

Given the context of the fraud alert source, we focus on transactions involving the account number `111-111111-101` and `111-111111-102`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We now merge the data for each matched transaction.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
We apply the bank and channel rules to each transaction.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We extract and apply the global fields from the fraud alert source.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Finally, we build the consolidated JSON output.

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the CSV records, matches them to the fraud alert source, and applies the necessary rules and transformations.",3148.0,3228.0
Search Warrant,3325,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
The fraud alert source does not contain any explicit transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we move to the next step.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since there are no transactions to extract from the fraud alert source, we need to check if there are any transactions in the CSV file that could be relevant based on the context provided in the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Given that there are no transactions in the fraud alert source, we will focus on the transaction in the CSV file and see if it matches the context provided in the fraud alert source.

#### CSV Transaction:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 25900
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Sending Bank Address:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Converted Amount:** 25900
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

#### Context from Fraud Alert Source:
- **Account Numbers Mentioned:** 111-111111-101 (CHUNG SIU), 111-111111-102 (CHAN TAI MAN)
- **Bank Mentioned:** Hang Seng Bank Limited

We can see that the CSV transaction involves the account number 111-111111-101, which is mentioned in the fraud alert source. However, the originator and beneficiary names do not fully match the names mentioned in the fraud alert source. We will still consider this transaction as potentially relevant.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **to.bank:** HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** Obtaining Property By Deception (as per the fraud alert source)
- **Police Reference:** Not provided in the source
- **Writ No.:** TM128717/2024
- **Contact Person:** SSGT 4155
- **Police Team:** Detective Police Constable 24■■■ LIU ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Based on the above steps, the final JSON output would be:

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""

    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 29-August-2024
   - Amount: HKD 12831
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 992-535728-826

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 30-August-2024
   - Amount: HKD 12831
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 985-735588-214

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** 12831
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 992-535728-826

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found a match in the first row:
  - **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
  - **Originator Name:** MR YIP HOI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** (empty)
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** 12831
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 985-735588-214

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found a match in the second row:
  - **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
  - **Originator Name:** (empty)
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** 12831
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR YIP HOI MAN
  - **Account Number:** (not available in CSV)
  - **Bank:** (not available in CSV)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** (empty)
  - **Account Number:** 992-535728-826
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ATM (based on description)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** null
- **Transaction References:** [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** 12831
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** (empty)
  - **Account Number:** (not available in CSV)
  - **Bank:** (not available in CSV)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number:** 985-735588-214
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ATM (based on description)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** null
- **Transaction References:** [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:**
  - From the source: External Fraud
  - Since it is ""External Fraud"", we use ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"" as the fraud type.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - For `from.bank` and `to.bank`, use the mappings provided.
  - `to.bank` is always ""HASE"".

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Both transactions have the description ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"". Since the source does not mention ATM specifically, we use ""cash"" for both transactions.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-29"",

This JSON output consolidates the extracted and matched transactions from the fraud alert source and the CSV records, applying all necessary rules and enriching the data accordingly.",2579.0,1448.0
UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 10 July 2024
- **Amount**: HKD 1.00
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 482-391974-358
- **Originator Name**: MISS SIN WEI HONG
- **Beneficiary Name**: Placeholder (not provided)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to match the extracted transaction to the CSV records. Let's look at the CSV record:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------------|
| 2024-07-10               | HKD                  | 1                  | C                      | Hang Seng Bank Ltd.   | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | 696-87403-304              | 482-391974-358             | MISS SIN WEI HONG          | Mr LI HOK MING AND OTHERS | Beneficiary     | CWTF                | Default transaction         |                           | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK | 1                    | b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d |

Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: HKD 1.00
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 482-391974-358
- **Originator Name**: MISS SIN WEI HONG
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr LI HOK MING AND OTHERS

Since the above criteria match, we can use the transaction ID `b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we can merge the data as follows:

- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: MISS SIN WEI HONG
  - **Account Number**: 696-87403-304
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **To**:
  - **Name**: Mr LI HOK MING AND OTHERS
  - **Account Number**: 482-391974-358
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS
- **can_be_located**: true
- **cancel_amount_requested**: 1.00 (as per the fraud alert source)
- **Transaction References**: [b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC"" is incorrect here, it should be ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."")
- **To Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (always ""HASE"")

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output would be:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-07-10"",

UAR,4305,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 12NOV24
- **Amount**: 26830 HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 382-657343-701
- **Remitting Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381 HKD

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the extracted transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 26830 HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 382-657343-701
- **Originator Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Beneficiary Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

Matching the transaction:
- **Transaction ID**: `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 26830 HKD
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Beneficiary Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 326-186461-555
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 382-657343-701
- **Originator Name**: LAM HOI SHAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR LAM HOI SHAN
- **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data with the fraud alert source details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 26830
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number**: 326-186461-555
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MR LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number**: 382-657343-701
  - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381
- **Transaction References**: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. → HASE
- **To Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited → HSBC
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transaction details from the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** 2024-11-11
- **Amount:** 2353.49
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 542-170681-918

- **Originator Name:** WONG KA MING
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR WONG KA MING

Match found in the CSV record:
- **Transaction ID:** 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-11-11
- **Amount:** 2353.49
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** WONG KA MING
- **Originator Account Number:** 542-170681-918
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR WONG KA MING
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 969-984363-416

- **Channel:** CWTF → FPS
- **Bank Codes:** BBAN 4 (HSBC) → HSBC, BBAN HKD (HSBC) → HSBC

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** HSBC (based on BBAN 4)
  - **to.bank:** HASE (as per the special handling rule)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** CWTF → FPS

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** 2353.49 (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Construct the final JSON output based on the merged and processed data:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-11"",

  ]
}

This JSON output adheres to the provided schema and includes all required fields.",4117.0,924.0
UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: Not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context to be around the time of the submission.
- **Amount**: HKD 130000
- **Currency**: HKD

Since the exact date is not provided, we cannot extract this transaction based on the strict requirement of having both date and amount. Therefore, we move forward without any transactions extracted from the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

Given the fraud type is ""External Fraud,"" we use this value directly.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we skip this step.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Since no transactions were extracted, the `alerted_transactions` array will be empty. Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []

- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Grand Total: 14 replacements","Let's go through the steps to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 21-Aug-2024
- **Amount**: HKD1651
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: Mr Cheung
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808
- **Description**: Customer Mr Cheung transferred HKD1651 on ATM to account number 819-444432-808 on 21-Aug-2024 to buy a vacuum cleaner.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will match the extracted transaction to the CSV record:
- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-08-21
  - **Originating Amount**: 1651
  - **Originator Account Number**: 723-330881-476
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808
  - **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Beneficiary Name**: HO WING KEI
  - **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 21-Aug-2024 (2024-08-21)
- **Amount**: 1651
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808

Since the date and amount match, and the beneficiary account number matches, we can use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Amount**: 1651
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Account Number**: 723-330881-476
- **Beneficiary Name**: HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808
- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719
- **Channel**: ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: Based on the originator account number `723-330881-476`, we don't have a direct mapping. We'll leave it as null.
- **to.bank**: Always ""HASE"" (as per the rules).

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-21"",
      ""amount"": 1651,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""TSANG MEI LIN"",
        ""account_number"": ""723-330881-476"",
        ""bank"": null
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""HO WING KEI"",
        ""account_number"": ""819-444432-808"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""
      },

      ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
      ""transaction_references"": [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the provided schema and includes all required fields.",2319.0,949.0
UAR,4325,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transaction details from the fraud alert source:

- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: 23221
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 364-913634-340
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 689-590116-505
- **Originator Name**: CHOW WEI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHOW WEI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Match the extracted transaction to the CSV record:

- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Originating Currency**: HKD
  - **Originating Amount**: 23221
  - **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
  - **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Originator Account Number**: 364-913634-340
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 689-590116-505
  - **Originator Name**: CHOW WEI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHOW WEI MAN
  - **Subject Type**: Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
  - **Sending Bank Account Number**: 
  - **Sending Bank Address**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Converted Amount**: 23221
  - **Transaction ID**: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

Since the date and amount match, we can use this CSV record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Merge the data from the CSV record into the extracted transaction:

- **Global Fields**:
  - **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

- **Transaction Fields**:
  - **Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Amount**: 23221
  - **Currency**: HKD
  - **From**:
    - **Name**: CHOW WEI MAN
    - **Account Number**: 364-913634-340
    - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (mapped to HSBC)
  - **To**:
    - **Name**: CHOW WEI MAN
    - **Account Number**: 689-590116-505
    - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (mapped to HASE)
  - **Channel**: CWTF (mapped to FPS)
  - **Can Be Located**: true
  - **Cancel Amount Requested**: 14143.95 (from the fraud alert source)
  - **Transaction References**: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (matches the rule for ""External Fraud"")

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From.Bank**: HSBC (mapped from The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
  - **To.Bank**: HASE (mapped from Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - **Channel**: FPS (mapped from CWTF)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**:
  - **Cancel Amount Requested**: 14143.95 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Construct the final JSON output based on the merged and processed data:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

ODFT,5062,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, there is no explicit mention of specific transactions with both date and amount. However, we can infer the total loss amount and the date from the provided information:

- **Total Loss Amount**: 16256 HKD
- **Date**: 2024-07-17

Since there is no detailed breakdown of individual transactions in the fraud alert source, we will consider the total loss amount as a single transaction.

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",
  ""amount"": 16256,
  ""currency"": ""HKD""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file for the extracted transaction.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-07-17
- **Amount**: 16256 HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 862-513276-255
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 626-906866-114
- **Originator Name**: MA CHI KEUNG
- **Beneficiary Name**: LI WEI HONG

Matching transaction in CSV:
```csv
2024-07-17,HKD,16256,C,,,862-513276-255,626-906866-114,MA CHI KEUNG,LI WEI HONG,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT,,,16256,2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
```

This transaction matches all the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we will merge the data:

- **Transaction ID**: 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
- **Originator Name**: MA CHI KEUNG
- **Beneficiary Name**: LI WEI HONG
- **Originator Account Number**: 862-513276-255
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 626-906866-114
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT
- **Transaction Type Source**: CUTF

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- **Fraud Type**: ""Others"" (since ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"" is mentioned)

**Bank Rules:**
- **from.bank**: HASE (Victim ODFT)
- **to.bank**: HASE (Suspect ODFT)

**Channel Rules:**
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT → ""ATM""

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: HASE (Victim ODFT)
- **to.bank**: HASE (Suspect ODFT)
- **channel**: ""ATM""

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and merged data, the final JSON output will be:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant information is:

- **Date**: 10DEC and 11DEC (which translates to 2024-12-10 and 2024-12-11)
- **Amount**: 47111

So, the extracted transactions are:
1. **Date**: 2024-12-10, **Amount**: 47111
2. **Date**: 2024-12-11, **Amount**: 47111

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

    - **Amount**: 47111
    - **Originator Account Number**: 174-404196-868
    - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 102-659333-750
    - **Originator Name**: (empty)
    - **Beneficiary Name**: HUI TAI MAN
    - **Transaction ID**: 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66

    - **Originator Name**: TSE HOK MING
    - **Beneficiary Name**: AU YEUNG TAI MING
    - **Transaction ID**: dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda

  - **Match Found**: Exact match found.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction ID**: 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66
- **Originator Name**: (empty) -> From fraud alert: MR TSE HOK MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: HUI TAI MAN
- **Transaction References**: [6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66]

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### For 2024-12-10, 47111
- **Channel**: ""ATM"" (based on Transaction Code Description: ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"")
- **Bank Codes**:
