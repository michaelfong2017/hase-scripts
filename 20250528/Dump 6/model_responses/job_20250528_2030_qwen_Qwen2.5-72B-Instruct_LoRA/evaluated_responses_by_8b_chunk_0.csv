1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning

The predicted output is not entirely satisfactory due to the following reasons:

1.  **Bank Name**: The predicted output contains the bank name ""BBAN"", which is not a recognized alias for the bank in the reference output. Although the actual bank name is not provided in the reference, it's likely that the predicted output is using an incorrect alias.

2.  **Account Numbers**: The account numbers are swapped between the ""from"" and ""to"" objects. In the reference output, the account number ""333-333333-101"" is associated with the ""to"" object, while in the predicted output, it's associated with the ""from"" object, and vice versa for the other account number.

These discrepancies result in a score of 0.8, indicating that 80% of the output is correct. The reason for the deduction is provided to highlight the areas that require improvement.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Bank names in 'from' and 'to' objects are incorrect. Expected 'from' account number to be '111-111111-101' and 'to' account number to be '333-333333-101'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Rationale:

The predicted output is mostly correct, but there are some discrepancies in the 'from' and 'to' objects of the first transaction. The 'from' object has the correct account number, but the 'to' object has the account number swapped with the 'from' object's account number. The 'bank' field in both 'from' and 'to' objects is also incorrect. 

The score is 0.8 because the predicted output is mostly correct, but there are some errors. The reason for the score is provided to highlight the areas that need improvement."

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

The predicted output has a score of 0.4, indicating partial correctness. 

1. The source field is correct.
2. The fraud_type is incorrect; it should be 'Internal Fraud' instead of 'External Fraud'. However, since the score is based on the presence and structure of fields, and the meaning of 'fraud_type' is not exact but semantically correct, a deduction of 0.3 is made for this field.
3. The 'alerted_transactions' field is present, but it contains two transactions instead of one. This is a major inconsistency.
4. In the first transaction:
   - The date is correct.
   - The amount is correct.
   - The 'from' object is incorrect: it contains a name, account_number, and bank, but the account_number is incorrect and the bank is not specified, which should be the case.
   - The 'to' object is correct.
5. In the second transaction:
   - The date is missing.
   - The amount is missing.
   - The 'from' object is missing.
   - The 'to' object is correct, but the account_number is not present.

Since the predicted output has several inconsistencies and missing fields, the score is 0.4.","### Evaluation Output
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.4,
  ""reason"": ""Missing required fields: 'from', 'fraud_type' does not match the reference, incorrect transaction details."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Explanation:

- The `source` field is correct.
- The `fraud_type` field is incorrect. The predicted output says ""External Fraud"", but the reference says ""External Fraud"" is not present. The closest match is ""External Fraud"" is not present in the reference but ""External"" is not present in the predicted output, but the word ""External"" is in the reference output as ""External Fraud"" which means the predicted output is partially correct. The score for this field is 0.5.
- The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array.
- For each transaction:
  - The `date` field is present and in a recognizable format, so it's correct.
  - The `amount` field is present and includes both currency and numeric value, so it's correct.
  - The `to` field is present and contains the required information, so it's correct.
  - The `from` field is missing, so it's incorrect.

Given the above points, the score is calculated as follows: (1 for source) + (0.5 for fraud_type) + (1 for date) + (1 for amount) + (1 for to) + (0 for from) = 4.5 out of 6, which is 0.75 when converted to a proportion. Since 0.75 is less than 1, the overall score is less than 1, and the predicted output is not satisfactory."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Reasoning:

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source` is present and correct.
  - `fraud_type` is present but incorrect. The predicted output says ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"" while the correct output says ""Employment Fraud"". This discrepancy results in a score deduction.
  - `police_reference` is present and correct.
  - `police_team` is present and correct.
  - `alerted_transactions` is present and contains one transaction.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - The date format in the predicted output is correct.
  - The amount in the predicted output is missing the currency symbol. This results in a score deduction.
  - The bank name in the predicted output is correct, with ""BOC"" being a known alias for the Bank of China.
  - The account number in the predicted output is correct.
  - The channel field is missing in the predicted output, but it's not a required field, so it doesn't affect the score.

Given the above points, the predicted output is mostly correct but has some discrepancies, resulting in a score of 0.75."

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - **source**: Present and matches the reference output.
   - **fraud_type**: Present and semantically matches the reference output.
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - **date**: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - **amount**: Present with both currency and numeric value.
   - **from**: Contains all required fields (name, account_number, bank).
   - **to**: Contains all required fields (name, account_number, bank).
   - **channel**: Not present, but not required.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - All fields are present and structured as in the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - Bank names are matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": null,
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

```

### Rationale

- The predicted output contains all required top-level fields: `source`, `fraud_type`, and `alerted_transactions`.
- The `alerted_transactions` array contains one transaction, which is the same number as in the reference output.
- Each transaction in the predicted output includes the required fields: `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to`.
- The `date` field is in a recognizable date format.
- The `amount` field includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences acceptable.
- The `from` and `to` objects contain the required fields: `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`, with equivalent names or abbreviations accepted.
- The `channel` field is not present, but it is not a required field, so it does not affect the evaluation.
- The predicted output is a valid, structured JSON.

Given that all conditions are met, the predicted output is considered satisfactory."

  ""reason"": ""Inconsistent bank account numbers between 'from' and 'to' transactions"",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Rationale

- The predicted output has the required fields at the top level: `source` and `fraud_type`. However, the `fraud_type` should be ""Internal Fraud"" instead of ""External Fraud"" to align with the reference output.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present, but it contains one transaction.
- For the transaction, the date and amount are correctly formatted, and the channel is correctly specified as ""FPS"".
- However, the bank names are correctly identified as ""HSBC"", but the account numbers are swapped between the ""from"" and ""to"" objects in the predicted output. This inconsistency results in a deduction of the score.

### Note

The score is set to 0.5 because the predicted output partially aligns with the reference output, but the critical error in the account numbers between the ""from"" and ""to"" objects prevents it from being fully satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Incorrect bank names for 'from' and 'to' transactions. Expected 'account_number' to be in a specific order."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reasoning

- The predicted output meets the guidelines for the top-level fields: source and fraud_type are correct, and alerted_transactions is present as an array.
- For the per-transaction fields:
  - date: Correctly formatted as ""2024-11-12"".
  - amount: Correctly includes currency (HKD) and numeric value (77,000.00).
  - from and to objects are present with name and account_number fields.
  - channel: Correctly indicates the payment method as ""FPS"".
- However, there are two issues with the predicted output:
  1. The bank names for both the ""from"" and ""to"" transactions are incorrect. The reference output has ""333-333333-101"" for the ""from"" account and ""111-111111-101"" for the ""to"" account, but the predicted output has them swapped.
  2. The bank name ""HSBC"" is not an issue since it is a valid bank name, but the predicted output has it listed in the ""from"" and ""to"" objects, which is not present in the reference output.
- Given these errors, the score is 0.8, indicating partial correctness."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}

### Rationale:

- The predicted output matches the reference output in all required fields.
- The source field is correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
- The fraud_type field is correctly identified as ""Romance Scam"".
- The police_reference field is correctly set to ""POLICEREF1"".
- The police_team field is correctly set to ""District Investigation Team 5"".
- The alerted_transactions array is present and contains 4 transactions.
- Each transaction has the required fields: date, amount, from, and to.
- Date format is correctly recognized as a date.
- Amount includes both currency and numeric value.
- Bank names are matched correctly, with ""HANG SENG BANK"" being a known alias for ""HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED"".
- There is one discrepancy in the bank name for one of the transactions. The predicted output has ""HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED"" while the reference output has ""HANG SENG BANK"". This results in a score of 0.9 (90% accuracy).

The score is calculated by counting the number of correct transactions and dividing it by the total number of transactions. In this case, all 4 transactions are correct except for the bank name discrepancy, resulting in a score of 0.9.","### Evaluation Output

Explanation:

- **Global Required Fields**: The predicted output has the required fields ""source"" and ""fraud_type"" at the top level, and ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: The predicted output includes the ""police_reference"" field, which is present in the reference output.
- **Global Optional Fields**: The predicted output does not include the ""police_team"" field, which is present in the reference output.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: 
  - The predicted output is missing the ""to"" field in all transactions, which is present in the reference output.
  - The predicted output does not include the ""channel"" field in any transactions, which is optional.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: 
  - The field presence and structure do not align with the reference output due to missing ""to"" fields and ""channel"" fields.
  - The predicted output is not semantically correct because the ""to"" fields are missing.
  - The score is 0.8 because the predicted output has some fields correct (e.g., ""source"", ""fraud_type"", ""police_reference"", and ""alerted_transactions"") but lacks others (e.g., ""to"" fields and ""channel"" fields)."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

The predicted output is mostly correct. However, there are two areas of discrepancy:

2. **police_team**: The predicted output is missing the 'Hong Kong Police Force' part, which is present in the correct output. This discrepancy reduces the score by 0.2.

Explanation:

- The 'police_reference', 'writ_no', and 'contact_person' fields are present and correct.
- The 'police_team' field is present but contains additional information not present in the reference output. The score deduction is 0.1 for this reason.
- The 'alerted_transactions' field is present and correct (empty array).

### Reasoning

The predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects.

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source` is correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - `fraud_type` is correctly set to ""Phishing Scam"", which matches the meaning of the correct output.
   - `alerted_transactions` is present as an array, containing three transactions.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction in the `alerted_transactions` array has the required fields:
     - `date` is present and follows a recognizable date format.
     - `amount` includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences.
     - `from` and `to` objects are present and contain the required fields:
       - `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` are correctly matched in both `from` and `to` objects.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
   - Bank names are correctly matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

Given that the predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects, the score is 1.0, indicating a perfect match.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 3,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 3
}
```

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source` is present and correct.
   - `fraud_type` is present and correct, with a slight variation in wording but still conveying the same meaning.
   - `alerted_transactions` is present as an array with three elements.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - All transactions have a `date` field with a recognizable date format.
   - All transactions have an `amount` field with both currency and numeric value.
   - All transactions have a `from` object with `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields, which are present in the correct order.
   - All transactions have a `to` object with `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields, which are present in the correct order.
   - There are no `channel` fields present, but this is not a required field, so it's not a deduction.

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Since all the required fields are present and correct, and the per-transaction fields are correctly formatted and aligned with the reference output, the predicted output is satisfactory with a score of 1.0."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Explanation:

The predicted output is not satisfactory due to the following issues:

1. The ""date"" field is missing for each transaction, which is a required field.
2. The ""from"" and ""to"" fields are present but contain extra information (name), which is not required.
3. The ""channel"" field is present, which is not required.
4. The ""fraud_type"" field has a different value than the reference output, although it conveys the same meaning.
5. The ""source"" field is correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".

The score is 0.5 because some fields are present but not correctly structured, and some are missing. The number of correct transactions is 0 because none of the transactions match the reference output.","### Evaluation Output

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0

### Explanation

- The `source` field is correct.
- The `fraud_type` field is incorrect as it should be equivalent to ""Internal Fraud"" but is instead ""External Fraud"".
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present but contains incorrect data. It should have two transactions with only the `amount` field, but instead has one transaction with `date`, `from`, and `to` fields, which are not required in the reference output.
- The `date` field is missing for both transactions in the reference output.
- The `from` and `to` fields are present but not required in the reference output.
- The `to` field has a different `name` value compared to the reference output.
- No transactions are correct."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - The ""source"" field is present and matches the expected value.
   - The ""fraud_type"" field is present and matches the expected meaning, but not exactly the expected string. However, since the meaning is the same, this is considered correct.
   - The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and is an array.

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - The ""date"" field is present and matches the expected format.
   - The ""amount"" field is present and matches the expected format.
   - The ""from"" object is present and contains the required fields, but the order of the fields is different from the correct output. This is a minor inconsistency.
   - The ""to"" object is present and contains the required fields.
   - The ""channel"" field is not present, which is not a requirement for this evaluation.

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - The predicted output has a valid structure and is well-formed JSON.
   - The values match the reference output semantically, even if the formatting differs in some cases.
   - The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

Given the minor inconsistency in the order of fields within the ""from"" object, the score is 0.75.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' and 'to' objects in the predicted output have different field order compared to the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Rationale

- The predicted output contains the required ""source"" field with the correct value.
- The ""fraud_type"" field has a matching meaning, but not an exact string match.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array, which is correct.
- The first transaction in the ""alerted_transactions"" array has a date field with a recognizable format.
- The amount field includes both currency and numeric value, and minor formatting differences are acceptable.
- The ""from"" object contains the required fields: ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"". However, the field order is different from the reference output, which deducts 20% from the total score.
- The ""to"" object also contains the required fields: ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"", and the field order is different from the reference output, which deducts another 20% from the total score.
- Since the predicted output is valid and structured JSON, the final score is 80%."

- The from and to objects contain the required fields (name, account_number, and bank), which match the reference output.
- The channel field is not present in the reference output, so it's not expected to be present in the predicted output.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""reason"": ""Inconsistencies in 'from' and 'to' objects."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output has the required fields at the top level, including ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". However, the value of ""fraud_type"" is not exactly the same as the reference output. While the reference output says ""External Fraud"", the predicted output says ""External Fraud"" which is semantically equivalent. Therefore, this is considered correct.

- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array, which is correct.

- In the first transaction, the ""date"" field is in a recognizable date format, so this is correct.

- The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value, which is correct.

- In the ""from"" object, the ""name"" field matches, but the ""account_number"" field does not match. This is considered incorrect.

- In the ""to"" object, the ""name"" field matches, but the ""account_number"" field does not match. This is considered incorrect.

- The ""channel"" field is present and indicates the payment method, which is correct.

Since there is only one transaction, the number of transactions total and correct are both 1, but since the ""from"" and ""to"" objects are not fully correct, the number of transactions correct is 0. The score is 0.75 because the predicted output is mostly correct but has some errors.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' and 'to' objects in the predicted output have mismatched account numbers. The 'from' object has account number '111-111111-101' while the 'to' object has account number '555-555555-101'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```
### Explanation:
The predicted output is mostly correct, but it has a mismatch in the 'from' and 'to' objects' account numbers. This accounts for a 20% deduction in the score."

Explanation:

1. The predicted output has the required fields at the top level, which is correct.
2. The `source` field is equal to ""Internal Referral"", which is correct.
3. The `fraud_type` is ""External Fraud"", which is semantically correct but not an exact match with the reference output. However, since it conveys the same meaning, it is considered correct.
4. The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array, which is correct.
5. Each transaction in the `alerted_transactions` array has the required fields:
   - `date` is present and follows a recognizable date format, which is correct.
   - `amount` includes both currency and numeric value, which is correct.
   - `from` and `to` objects are present and contain the required fields:
     - `name` is present in both objects, which is correct.
     - `account_number` is present in both objects but is incorrect in the predicted output. This is the main deduction point.
     - `bank` is present in both objects but contains an incorrect bank name in the predicted output. This is another deduction point.
   - `channel` is present and indicates the payment method, which is correct.
6. The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

The score is 0.5 because the predicted output is partially correct but contains significant errors in the `from` and `to` fields."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Explanation:

- The `source` field is present and correct.
- The `fraud_type` field is present and matches the reference output.
- The `police_reference` field is present and correct.
- The `police_team` field is present and correct.
- The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array, but it contains only one transaction.
- The `date` field is present and follows a recognizable date format.
- The `amount` field is present and includes both currency and numeric value.
- The `from` object is present and contains the `account_number` and `bank` fields, which match the reference output.
- However, the `to` object is missing from the predicted output, which is a required field for each transaction according to the reference output. This is the main reason for the low score.
- Since there is only one transaction, the `number_of_transactions_total` and `number_of_transactions_correct` fields are set accordingly.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""reason"": ""Missing 'to' field in the first transaction. Missing 'channel' field in the first transaction."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Explanation:

- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields are present and correct.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: The field ""police_reference"" is present in the predicted output and matches the reference output.
- **Global Optional Fields**: The field ""police_team"" is present in the predicted output and matches the reference output.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: 
  - The ""date"" field is present and correct.
  - The ""amount"" field is present and correct.
  - The ""from"" field is present and correct.
  - However, the ""to"" field is missing, which is a conditionally required field.
  - The ""channel"" field is missing, which is an optional field but present in the reference output.

The score is 0.6 because the predicted output is partially correct but lacks some required fields in the transactions."

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Explanation:

- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.
- The'source' field matches the reference output.
- The 'fraud_type' field is semantically correct but has a minor wording difference.
- The 'alerted_transactions' array is present and contains two transactions.

### Correctness Issues:

- 'date' field values do not match the reference output (2024-12-10 and 2024-12-11 vs 2023-12-10 and 2023-12-11).
- 'amount' field values match the reference output.
- 'from' objects contain all required fields, but the account number format does not match the reference output (22222222101 vs 222-222222-101).
- 'to' objects are present but lack required fields (name, account_number, bank) and their values are unknown.
- 'channel' field values match the reference output.

### Partial Correctness:

- The predicted output includes all required fields at the top level.
- The 'fraud_type' field is semantically correct.
- The 'amount' field values match the reference output.
- The 'channel' field values match the reference output.

### Deductions:

- The predicted output lacks the required 'date' field format consistency.
- The predicted output lacks the required 'bank' field in the 'from' and 'to' objects.
- The predicted output lacks the required 'account_number' format consistency.
- The predicted output lacks the required 'to' object fields (name, account_number, bank).

### Score Calculation:

The score is calculated based on the number of correct and incorrect fields. A score of 0.5 indicates that half of the required fields were correct.

### Recommendation:

To improve the predicted output, ensure that the 'date' field values match the reference output, the 'from' and 'to' objects contain all required fields, and the 'account_number' format is consistent with the reference output.","### Evaluation Output

}
```

### Explanation

1. Global Required Fields:
   - The predicted output has the correct `source` field.
   - The `fraud_type` is correct in meaning, but not in wording.
   - The `alerted_transactions` array is present.

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - Both transactions are missing the `bank` field in the `from` object, which is a required field.
   - The `to` object is partially incorrect, as it contains `account_number` and `bank` with values of ""Unknown"".
   - The `date` field is partially incorrect, as it is 2024 instead of 2023.
   - The `channel` field is partially incorrect, as it is ""ATM"" instead of ""Others"".

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - The predicted output is structured as valid JSON.
   - The score reflects the partial correctness of the output."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

### Rationale:

- The source field is correctly set to ""Search Warrant"" (1 point).
- The alerted_transactions field is present as an array (1 point).
- The police_reference, writ_no, and contact_person fields are present, but the police_team field is missing (0.5 points for presence of conditional fields).
- The police_team field in the predicted output is empty, but in the reference output, it's set to ""N/A"" (0.1 points for incorrect value).
- The fraud_type field is missing in the predicted output (0.2 points for missing field).
- Since there are no transactions, the number of transactions is 0, and the number of correct transactions is also 0.","### Evaluation Output:

### Reasoning:

1.  The ""source"" field is present and correct.
2.  The ""fraud_type"" field is missing or incorrect. It should be ""Financial Crime Compliance"" according to the reference output. This is a significant error and reduces the overall score to 0.5.
3.  The ""police_reference"", ""writ_no"", and ""contact_person"" fields are present and correct.
4.  The ""police_team"" field is present but should be ""N/A"" according to the reference output. However, since it's not a required field, this is not a critical error.
5.  The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and correct (as an empty array).
6.  Since the predicted output does not contain any transactions, the number of transactions is 0, and none are correct."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case IP YUEN ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

- The field ""police_reference"" is conditionally required and present, as well as ""police_team"", which is optional.
- For the transaction, the ""date"" field is correctly formatted.
- However, the ""amount"" field is missing the currency value (""HKD"") in the predicted output.
- In the ""from"" object, the structure is correct.
- In the ""to"" object, the structure is incorrect because the ""account_number"" is placed under ""to"" instead of ""from"" in the predicted output.

### Note:
The score of 0.8 reflects that the predicted output is mostly correct, with only two minor errors.","### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""fraud_type field does not match, alerted_transactions structure is mostly correct, but one transaction is missing the 'channel' field and 'amount' is missing currency."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

Explanation:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - ""source"" is correct.
   - ""fraud_type"" is incorrect. The predicted output says ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"", but the reference output says ""Bounced Cheque"". Although the predicted output is semantically close, the correct fraud type is not matched exactly.
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present and is an array.

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""police_reference"" is present in both outputs.

3. Global Optional Fields:
   - ""police_team"" is present in both outputs.

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""date"" is correct in both outputs.
   - ""amount"" is partially correct in the predicted output. It's missing the currency, which is present in the reference output.
   - ""from"" and ""to"" are mostly correct in both outputs, but ""to"" is missing the account_number in the predicted output and ""from"" is missing the channel in the predicted output.
   - ""channel"" is missing in the predicted output.

The score is 0.6 because the predicted output is mostly correct, but there are some inaccuracies and missing fields."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP LAM ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.

### Reasoning:

- The'source' field is correct and matches the reference output.
- The 'fraud_type' field is correct and matches the reference output in meaning, although the wording is not identical.
- The 'police_reference' field is correct and matches the reference output.
- The 'police_team' field is partially correct, but it contains an extra 'Yuen Long District' which is not present in the reference output. This results in a deduction of 0.3 from the score.
- The 'alerted_transactions' array is present and not empty, which is a requirement.
- Within the 'alerted_transactions' array, the 'date' field is correct and matches the reference output in format.
- The 'amount' field is correct and matches the reference output in format and value.
- However, the 'from' and 'to' fields are missing required fields (name, account_number, or bank), which results in a deduction of 0.2 from the score.
- The 'channel' field is present but incorrect, which results in a deduction of 0.5 from the score.

The overall score is 0.5, indicating that the predicted output is partially correct.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation:

- The predicted output has the required ""source"" and ""fraud_type"" fields.
- It includes the conditionally required ""police_reference"" field.
- It includes the optional ""police_team"" field, but the value is incorrect.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" array is present.
- For the single transaction, the ""date"" field is correct.
- The ""amount"" field is missing its ""currency"" value.
- The ""from"" and ""to"" objects are missing required fields.
- The ""channel"" field has an incorrect value.
- Since the predicted output is not entirely correct, the ""is_satisfactory"" field is set to false.
- The score is calculated based on the number of correct fields (date = 1) out of the total number of fields (date + amount + from + to + channel + police_team + police_reference) that could be correct (7), resulting in a score of 1/7 = 0.1429. However, considering the presence of the ""police_reference"" field, which is conditionally required, the score is adjusted to 2/8 = 0.25. Then, considering the presence of the ""date"" field, which is a required field, the score is adjusted to 3/9 = 0.3333. Finally, considering the presence of the ""police_reference"" and ""date"" fields, which are conditionally and required fields respectively, the score is adjusted to 4/10 = 0.4. However, considering the presence of the ""police_reference"" field, which is conditionally required, the score is adjusted to 5/11 = 0.4545. Then, considering the presence of the ""date"" field, which is a required field, the score is adjusted to 6/12 = 0.5. Finally, considering the presence of the ""police_reference"" and ""date"" fields, which are conditionally and required fields respectively, the score is adjusted to 7/13 = 0.5385. However, considering the presence of the ""police_reference"" field, which is conditionally required, the score is adjusted to 8/14 = 0.5714.

This score reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output."

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields**: 
   - The predicted output has the required field'source' with the correct value 'ADCC'. 
   - The field 'fraud_type' is also present and correctly indicates 'Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service'.
   - The 'alerted_transactions' field is present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: 
   - The field 'police_reference' is present in the predicted output with the same value as in the correct output.
   - The field 'police_team' is also present in the predicted output with the same value as in the correct output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**: 
   - The field 'police_team' is present in the predicted output with the same value as in the correct output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The transaction in the 'alerted_transactions' array has the required fields 'date', 'amount', 'from', and 'to'.
   - The 'date' field is in a recognizable date format.
   - The 'amount' field includes both currency and numeric value.
   - The 'from' and 'to' objects contain the required fields 'name' and 'account_number'. However, the 'from' object also includes the field 'bank' which is not present in the correct output.

The score is 0.9 because the predicted output is almost identical to the correct output, but it includes an extra field 'channel' in the 'from' transaction which is not present in the correct output.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'bank' in 'from' object has a known alias 'HSB' for 'HSBC'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Rationale:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - **source**: Present and correct.
   - **fraud_type**: Present and correct in terms of meaning, although the wording is exact.
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
   - **police_reference**: Present and correct.

3. Global Optional Fields:
   - **police_team**: Present and correct.

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - **date**: Present and in a recognizable date format.
   - **amount**: Present with currency and numeric value, although minor formatting differences exist.
   - **from**: Present with 'name' and 'account_number'. However, 'bank' is missing but has a known alias 'HSB' for 'HSBC'.
   - **to**: Present with 'name', 'account_number', and 'bank', although the bank name 'HSB' is not the preferred 'HSBC'.

The score of 0.9 reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, considering the known alias for 'HSB' as 'HSBC' in the 'from' object."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - **fraud_type**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and expressing the same meaning (""Impersonation"").
   - **alerted_transactions**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present as an array containing one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and following a recognizable date format (""2024-12-03"").
   - **amount**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and including both currency and numeric value (""HKD 50,001.00"").
   - **from**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and containing the required subfields:
     - **name**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - **account_number**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""333-333333-101"".
     - **bank**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (exact match).
   - **to**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and containing the required subfields:
     - **name**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - **account_number**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""111-111111-101"".
     - **bank**: The predicted output matches the reference output, with the field present and equal to ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."" (exact match).

Since all fields are present and match the reference output, the score is 1.0, indicating perfect match.","### Evaluation Output
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Transaction details 'from' object has account_number before name, but in the reference output, it's the other way around."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Explanation

- **Global Required Fields**: The predicted output includes the required fields ""source"" and ""fraud_type"", both of which match the reference output. However, ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array, so this criterion is met.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: For the single transaction in the array, the following fields are present:
  - ""date"" matches the reference output.
  - ""amount"" matches the reference output, including currency and numeric value.
  - ""from"" and ""to"" objects are present, each containing the required fields. However, the order of fields within the ""from"" object is different from the reference output, which deducts from the overall score.

- **Evaluation Criteria**: The predicted output is valid JSON, and the field presence and structure align with the reference output, except for the order of fields in the ""from"" object. The score is adjusted accordingly to reflect partial correctness."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  - The ""amount"" field is present and includes both currency and numeric value.
  - The ""from"" object is present, but it contains an ""account_number"" field that is not present in the reference output. The ""bank"" field is also present, but its value does not match the reference output. Only the ""name"" field is correct.
  - The ""to"" object is present, and its ""name"" field matches the reference output. However, the ""account_number"" field is not present in the reference output, and the ""bank"" field has a mismatched value.
  - The ""channel"" field is present and has a value that matches the reference output.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP TSANG ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Explanation:
The predicted output is not entirely correct. It has a score of 0.8 due to the following reasons:

- It has all the required fields at the top level.
- The `police_reference` and `police_team` fields are present.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains one transaction.
- The transaction has a recognizable date format, and the amount includes currency and numeric value.
- The `from` object contains an `account_number` and a `bank` field with the correct value.
- However, the `to` object has an extra `bank` field, which is not present in the reference output. The `name` field is missing in the `to` object, which is present in the reference output.

Note that the score is 0.8 because the predicted output is mostly correct, but it has some minor errors.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""fraud_type field does not match exactly, alerted_transactions[0].to.bank field is missing, alerted_transactions[0].to.channel field is missing"",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reasoning:

- The `source` field is present and correct.
- The `fraud_type` field is present but does not match exactly with the reference output. Although it expresses a similar meaning, it is not the same. This results in a score deduction.
- The `police_reference` field is present and correct.
- The `police_team` field is present and correct.
- The `alerted_transactions` field is present and contains one transaction.
- In the `alerted_transactions[0]`, the `date` field is present and correct.
- The `amount` field is present and correct, including currency and numeric value.
- In the `alerted_transactions[0].from` object, the `account_number` field is present and correct, and the `bank` field is present and correct.
- In the `alerted_transactions[0].to` object, the `account_number` field is present and correct, but the `name` field is missing, and the `bank` field is present and correct. The `channel` field is missing, which is a conditionally required field for each transaction. This results in a score deduction.
- Since the `alerted_transactions` array contains only one transaction, the `number_of_transactions_total` and `number_of_transactions_correct` are both 1."

}","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""** reported on **2024-09-03** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 5-■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

### Explanation:

The predicted output is mostly correct. However, it contains a discrepancy in the 'from' object of the first transaction. The 'bank' field is present in the predicted output with the value 'HSBC', but it is not present in the reference output. Although 'HSBC' is equivalent to 'HSB', the absence of the 'bank' field in the reference output is a deviation. This discrepancy deducts from the overall score.

### Score Breakdown:

- Global Required Fields: 1.0 (All required fields are present)
- Global Conditionally Required Fields: 1.0 (police_reference is present)
- Global Optional Fields: 0.8 (police_team is present, but the score is reduced due to the discrepancy in the 'from' object)

### Rationale

1. Global Required Fields:

   - ""fraud_type"" is present and expresses the same meaning as the reference fraud type (score: 1.0)
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array (score: 1.0)

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""police_reference"" is present in the predicted output (score: 1.0)
   - ""police_team"" is present in the predicted output (score: 1.0)

3. Global Optional Fields:
   - ""police_team"" is present in the predicted output (score: 1.0)

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""date"" is present and follows a recognizable date format (score: 1.0)
   - ""amount"" is present and includes both currency and numeric value (score: 1.0)
   - ""from"" and ""to"" objects are present (score: 1.0)
     - ""from"" object contains ""name"" and ""account_number"" (score: 0.8, deduction for 'account_number' position)
     - ""to"" object contains ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"" (score: 0.8, deduction for minor inconsistency in field order, but 'bank' is correct)
   - ""channel"" is not present (score: 1.0, as it is an optional field)

The overall score is 0.9, as there are minor inconsistencies in the field order within the ""from"" and ""to"" objects."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output is missing the global conditionally required fields date, amount, from, and to for each transaction, which is expected in the alerted_transactions array. Since the array is empty, the number of transactions is 0, and the number of correct transactions is also 0.

- The source field is present and correct.

- The fraud_type field is incorrect. The predicted output includes additional details not present in the reference output. The reference output has ""Obtaining Property By Deception"" while the predicted output has ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". This deducts 20% from the score.

- The police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team fields are present and correct.

- The alerted_transactions array is present but empty, which is correct.

- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.","### Evaluation Output

  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' field contains extra details, which are not present in the correct output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reasoning

The predicted output contains all required fields at the top level, including ""source"", ""fraud_type"", and ""alerted_transactions"". The ""fraud_type"" field contains extra details (""contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"") that are not present in the correct output, which is a deviation from the guidelines. However, since the meaning of ""Obtaining Property By Deception"" is preserved, this can be considered a minor error.

The ""police_reference"", ""writ_no"", and ""contact_person"" fields are present, which are conditionally required. The ""police_team"" field is also included, which is optional but present in the correct output.

Since there are no transactions in the alerted_transactions array, the number of correct transactions is 0."

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output is a valid JSON.
- The source field is correct.
- The fraud_type field is partially correct, as it expresses the same meaning as the reference fraud type, but the wording is not exact. Score: 0.67 (1 for correctness of meaning, 0.33 for exact wording).
- The alerted_transactions array is present.
- The date field is correct.
- The amount field is correct.
- The 'from' object is partially correct, as it contains the name and account_number fields, but the account_number is incorrect. Score: 0.5 (1 for presence of name and account_number, 0.5 for incorrect account_number).
- The 'to' object is partially correct, as it contains the name and account_number fields, but the account_number is incorrect. Score: 0.5 (1 for presence of name and account_number, 0.5 for incorrect account_number).
- The channel field is present and correct.

Since the predicted output has some inaccuracies in the 'from' and 'to' account numbers, the overall score is 0.67 (0.5 for 'from' object, 0.5 for 'to' object, and 0.67 for the fraud_type field).","### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Explanation:

- The predicted output is a valid, structured JSON.
- The `source` field is correct and equals ""Internal Referral"".
- The `fraud_type` field is incorrect, as it should be ""External"" or a synonym, but the predicted output says ""External Fraud"". However, since ""External"" is a synonym of ""External Fraud"", this is considered a partial correctness and the score is not deducted for this field.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and not empty.
- In the first transaction:
  - The `date` field is correct and follows a recognizable date format.
  - The `amount` field is correct and includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences (spacing, punctuation) being acceptable.
  - The `from` object contains `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields, which are partially correct but not entirely. The `bank` field has a correct alias (""HASE""), but the account number is incorrect.
  - The `to` object contains `name` and `account_number` fields, which are partially correct but not entirely. The `bank` field has a correct alias (""HASE""), but the account number is incorrect.
  - The `channel` field is present and indicates the payment method.

The score is 0.6 because two out of the three fields in the `from` and `to` objects are incorrect, which accounts for 66.67% of the total possible errors in those fields."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""Inconsistent account numbers in 'to' field and missing 'bank' field in 'from' field in the second transaction."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

The predicted output has most of the required fields and structure, but there are some inconsistencies and missing fields. Here's a breakdown of the evaluation:

- **source**: Correctly identified as ""Internal Referral"".
- **fraud_type**: The predicted output says ""External Fraud"", which is semantically correct but not exactly what the reference output says. However, since the meaning is correct, this is considered a minor variation.
- **alerted_transactions**: The array is present and has two transactions.
- **date**: Both transactions have a date in a recognizable format.
- **amount**: Both transactions have an amount with currency and numeric value.
- **from**: The first transaction has a ""name"" field, which is correct. However, the ""bank"" field is missing. The second transaction is missing the ""bank"" field altogether.
- **to**: The first transaction has both ""name"" and ""account_number"" fields, which are correct. The second transaction has ""name"" and ""account_number"" fields, but the account number is partially redacted.
- **channel**: Both transactions have a ""channel"" field with the same value, which is correct.

The score of 0.6 reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output. The reason for the deduction is the inconsistent account numbers in the ""to"" field and the missing ""bank"" field in the ""from"" field in the second transaction.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Predicted output contains extra information and missing information for the 'from' field in the second transaction."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Reasoning

The predicted output has a score of 0.5 due to the following reasons:

- **Source**: The source field is correctly set to ""Internal Referral"", which is satisfactory.
- **Fraud Type**: The predicted fraud type ""External Fraud"" is not the same as the reference fraud type, which is missing in the reference output. However, since the reference does not explicitly state the fraud type, we will consider this as a minor discrepancy. The predicted output is still satisfactory in terms of the meaning conveyed.
- **Alerted Transactions**: The predicted output contains two transactions, which is satisfactory.
- **Transaction 1**: The first transaction in the predicted output is mostly correct:
  - **Date**: The date ""2025-01-03"" matches the reference.
  - **Amount**: The amount ""HKD 64,348.00"" matches the reference.
  - **From**: The ""name"" field is present and matches the reference. However, the ""account_number"" field is missing in the reference, which is a discrepancy.
  - **To**: The ""name"" and ""account_number"" fields match the reference.
- **Transaction 2**: The second transaction in the predicted output is partially correct:
  - **Date**: The date ""2025-01-03"" matches the reference.
  - **Amount**: The amount ""HKD 32,300.00"" matches the reference.
  - **From**: The ""name"" field is missing in the reference, which is a discrepancy.
  - **To**: The ""name"" field matches the reference, but the ""account_number"" field is partially redacted in the predicted output.

Overall, the predicted output contains extra information and missing information for the 'from' field in the second transaction, which is why it is not entirely satisfactory."

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output meets the Global Required Fields criteria:
  - source: ""Search Warrant"" matches the requirement.
  - fraud_type: Although the predicted output includes an extra detail, the main meaning (""Obtaining Property By Deception"") aligns with the reference output.
  - alerted_transactions: Present as an empty array.

- The predicted output partially meets the Global Conditionally Required Fields criteria:
  - police_reference: Present.
  - writ_no: Present.
  - contact_person: Present.

- The predicted output includes an extra Global Optional Field:
  - police_team: Present in the predicted output but not in the reference output.

- Since there are no transactions in the reference output, there are no Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields to evaluate.

The score of 0.8 reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, considering the extra detail in the fraud_type field and the presence of the police_team field.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' field contains an additional description that is not present in the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Rationale:

- The predicted output has a satisfactory score of 0.8 because it includes all required fields, but contains an extra detail in the 'fraud_type' field. This is considered a partial correctness, hence the score is not 1.0.

- The 'is_satisfactory' field is set to 'false' because the predicted output is not entirely correct.

- The'reason' field provides an explanation for the deduction, highlighting the discrepancy in the 'fraud_type' field.

- The 'number_of_transactions_total' and 'number_of_transactions_correct' fields are both 0, as there are no transactions in the 'alerted_transactions' array."

Explanation:

- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

- The 'alerted_transactions' array is present but contains only one transaction.
- The 'date' field is present and in a recognizable date format.
- The 'amount' field is missing the currency, which is a required field.
- The 'from' object is missing the required fields 'name', 'account_number', or 'bank'.
- The 'to' object is present but contains only 'account_number', missing 'name'.
- The 'channel' field is present but has a value mismatch (""ATM"" instead of ""Others"").

The score is 0.6 because some fields are missing or have minor differences, but the structure and some values are correct.","### Evaluation Output:

```

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output is valid JSON and includes all required fields at the top level.
- The `source` field is correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
- The `fraud_type` field is not exactly matched but is semantically correct, as ""Impersonation"" is the same meaning as the reference.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains one transaction.

However, the following issues were found in the predicted output:
- The `from` object is missing, which is conditionally required.
- The `amount` field is missing its currency, which is conditionally required.
- The `to` object is missing the `name` field, which is conditionally required.

These issues result in a score of 0.4, indicating partial correctness."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Predicted output is mostly correct, but some field ordering and formatting are different."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Explanation:

- The predicted output is mostly correct, but some field ordering and formatting are different.
- The field ""amount"" in the predicted output has a space between the numeric value and the currency, which is not present in the reference output.
- The field ""channel"" is missing in the predicted output, which is not required in this case, but its presence in the reference output would have added to the score.
- The field ordering in the predicted output is different from the reference output. However, this is not a critical error, and the overall structure is correct.
- The ""fraud_type"" is correct, even though the wording is not an exact match.
- The ""police_reference"" and ""police_team"" are correctly included.
- The ""date"" is correctly formatted.
- The ""from"" and ""to"" objects are correctly structured, and the values match semantically.

### Score Breakdown:

- Global Required Fields: 1.0 (all fields present)
- Global Conditionally Required Fields: 1.0 (all present in reference output)
- Global Optional Fields: 1.0 (all present in reference output)
- Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields: 0.8 (some minor formatting differences)
- Total Score: 0.8","### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'amount' field in the 'alerted_transactions' array has a minor formatting difference. The predicted output uses a space between the amount and currency, while the reference output uses a hyphen. Also, the 'from' and 'to' objects are swapped in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Reasoning:

- The predicted output contains all the required fields, including source, fraud_type, police_reference, police_team, and alerted_transactions.
- The alerted_transactions array contains one transaction, which has the required fields date, amount, from, and to.
- However, the amount field in the predicted output uses a space between the amount and currency, while the reference output uses a hyphen. This is considered a minor formatting difference, so the score is not significantly penalized.
- The 'from' and 'to' objects are swapped in the predicted output, which is a more significant difference. This is not present in the reference output, resulting in a deduction.
- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON, so no deductions are made for this criterion."
