I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP SO ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Both outputs have it set to ""Police Letter"". ✔️
   - `fraud_type`: The predicted output has ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"", while the reference output has ""Employment Fraud"". These do not semantically match. ❌
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array. ✔️

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present in both outputs with the same value ""POLICEREF3"". ✔️

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present in both outputs with the same value ""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit"". ✔️

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format ""2025-01-02"" in both outputs. ✔️
   - `amount`: The reference output specifies ""HK$4000"", whereas the predicted output just has ""4000"". This minor difference in formatting is acceptable, but ideally, it should include the currency symbol. ✔️ (with minor issue)
   - `from.bank`: Present and correctly specified as ""BOC"" in both outputs. ✔️
   - `from.account_number`: Present and correctly specified as ""444-4444444-104"" in both outputs. ✔️

### Evaluation Summary:
- **Field presence and structure**: All necessary fields are present, and the structure matches the reference output.
- **Values**: Most values match semantically, except for the `fraud_type` which does not align.
- **Formatting**: Minor formatting issues noted for the `amount`.

Given these points, the output is partially correct due to the mismatch in `fraud_type`. 

Here’s the evaluation output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match semantically with the reference output. Additionally, there is a minor formatting issue with the 'amount'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects the partial correctness and the importance of the `fraud_type` field."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 5"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted for all transactions.
   - `amount`: Present, but missing currency symbol ""HK$"" in the predicted output.
   - `from`: Present and contains the required subfields (`bank` and `account_number`) for all transactions.
   - `to`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the correct output.

Given these observations:

- All global required and conditionally required fields are present.
- Each transaction has `date`, `amount`, and `from` fields, but the `to` field is missing.
- The `amount` field lacks the currency symbol in the predicted output, which is a minor formatting issue.

The predicted output is mostly correct but misses the `to` field in each transaction, which significantly affects its accuracy.

### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to' field is missing in each transaction, which impacts the completeness of the data. Additionally, the 'amount' field lacks the currency symbol 'HK$', although this is a minor formatting issue."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects that while many fields are correctly identified and structured, the absence of the `to` field in all transactions significantly reduces the overall accuracy."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name

- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Search Warrant"".
   - `fraud_type`: The predicted output includes ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"", which semantically matches the reference output ""Obtaining Property By Deception"". This is acceptable.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an empty array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Correctly provided as ""POLICEREF1"".
   - `writ_no`: Correctly provided as ""TM ■■■■"".
   - `contact_person`: Correctly provided as ""PC ■■■■■"".

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present in both the predicted and reference outputs. The predicted output has ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad Yuen Long District"" while the reference output has ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad Yuen Long District, Hong Kong Police Force"". This minor difference does not significantly affect the meaning and is acceptable.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - Since there are no transactions listed (`alerted_transactions` is an empty array), these do not apply.

### Final Assessment:

- **Field presence and structure** align with the reference output.
- **Values** match semantically, even with slight variations in wording and detail.
- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Given this assessment, the predicted output meets all the necessary criteria, with only minor acceptable differences in the optional `police_team` field.

### Evaluation

- **Global Required Fields**
  - `source`: Correct (""Internal Referral"").
  - `fraud_type`: Correct (""External Fraud"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and structured correctly as an array.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
  - For each transaction, the `amount` field is correctly formatted and present.
  - Other fields such as `date`, `from`, `to`, and `channel` are present in the predicted output but are either empty or not necessary according to the reference output. This does not negatively impact the score since these fields are conditionally required only if they exist in the reference.

- **Field Presence and Structure**
  - The predicted output has more detailed information than necessary but does not violate any rules.
  - The structure is valid JSON and aligns with the reference output's structure.

- **Values Matching Semantically**
  - The values for `source`, `fraud_type`, and `amount` match semantically.

### Deduction Areas
- The predicted output includes additional details (`date`, `from`, `to`, `channel`) that are not required based on the reference output. However, this does not affect the overall correctness since these fields are optional and do not cause structural issues.

### Final Assessment
```json

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 2

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields are correctly present.
- **Fraud Type**: Matches semantically.
- **Transactions**: Only one transaction is provided in the prediction whereas the reference has two transactions. However, the single transaction's amount matches correctly.
- **Per-Transaction Fields**: The predicted output includes fields like `date`, `from`, and `to` which are not present in the reference output. This leads to a deduction in the score as these fields are unnecessary.
- **Structure**: The overall structure is correct, but the content within `alerted_transactions` is incomplete compared to the reference."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

Explanation:
- The `source` and `fraud_type` fields are correct.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains one transaction.
- The transaction's `date`, `amount`, and `channel` fields are correct.
- However, the `from` and `to` fields have their account details swapped, which makes the transaction information incorrect. This significantly impacts the overall correctness of the transaction data."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

Explanation:
- All global required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are correctly present.
- The conditionally required field `police_reference` is present.
- The optional field `police_team` is correctly included.
- Within the transaction, `date`, `amount`, and `from` fields are correctly present and formatted.
- However, the `to` field, which is present in the reference output, is missing in the predicted output. This results in the transaction being considered incorrect, leading to a lower score.","### Evaluation:

#### Analysis:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Investment Scam"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly set to ""POLICEREF1"".

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly set to ""District Investigation Team 4"".

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes:
     - `date`: Present and correctly formatted as ""2024-07-26"".
     - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted as ""HK$10000"".
     - `from`: Present and contains:
       - `account_number`: Correctly set to ""66666666601"".
       - `bank`: Correctly set to ""CCB"".
     - `to`: Missing in the predicted output, which is incorrect since it is present in the reference output.
     - `channel`: Not applicable here as it is optional and not provided in the reference.

#### Score Breakdown:
- The predicted output is mostly correct except for the missing `to` field within the transaction object.
- Since the `to` field is conditionally required when present in the reference output, its absence affects the overall accuracy.

#### Final Assessment:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to' field within the transaction object is missing, which is required as per the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The predicted output is structurally correct and most of the fields are accurately represented, but the omission of the `to` field within the transaction object leads to a deduction in the score."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Victim ODFT case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Victim ODFT"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

```","Based on the provided outputs, here is the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Both outputs have the correct value ""Victim ODFT"".
   - `fraud_type`: Both outputs indicate ""Impersonation"", which matches semantically.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present in both outputs.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: The year is different (2024 vs 2023), but the format is correct.
   - `amount`: Matches correctly in both outputs.
   - `from.name`: Matches correctly in both outputs.
   - `from.account_number`: The format is slightly different (""22222222101"" vs ""222-222222-101""), but the values represent the same account number.
   - `from.bank`: The reference output does not include this field, so its presence in the predicted output is not penalized.
   - `to`: The reference output does not include this field, so its presence in the predicted output is not penalized.
   - `channel`: The channel is different (""ATM"" vs ""Others""). This discrepancy affects the accuracy of the transactions.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Overall, the predicted output is mostly correct but has some discrepancies:
     - Incorrect year in the date field.
     - Different format in the account number.
     - Incorrect channel information.

Given these observations, the evaluation output is:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.85,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output contains minor discrepancies such as incorrect year in the date field, different format in the account number, and incorrect channel information."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects that while most fields are correct, there are notable discrepancies affecting the overall accuracy.","### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array containing two transactions.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Both transactions in the predicted output have:
     - `date`: Correct format but incorrect year (2024 vs 2023).
     - `amount`: Correctly formatted and matching the reference.
     - `from`: Contains `name` and `account_number`, which match the reference. The predicted output includes an additional `bank` field, which is optional and does not affect correctness.
     - `to`: Present in the predicted output but absent in the reference. This inclusion does not affect correctness negatively since it's optional.
     - `channel`: Present and contains ""ATM"" instead of ""Others"". This is a discrepancy.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The overall structure and most fields are correctly aligned with the reference.
   - The dates have the correct format but an incorrect year, which slightly affects accuracy.
   - The `channel` field has a discrepancy (""ATM"" vs ""Others""), which impacts correctness.

### Score Breakdown:
- **Date Accuracy**: Minor deduction due to incorrect year.
- **Channel Mismatch**: Deduction due to different channel specified.
- **Additional Fields**: No penalty for including extra optional fields like `bank` or `to`.

Given these points, the predicted output is largely satisfactory but has some minor inaccuracies.

### Evaluation Output:
```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.85,

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

Explanation:
- The `source` field is correctly set to ""Search Warrant"".
- The `fraud_type` field is required but left empty in the predicted output, leading to a deduction in score.
- The `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` fields are correctly present and match the reference output.
- The `police_team` field is optional and its inclusion does not affect the score negatively.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is correctly present and empty, as in the reference output.
- Overall, the structure and most fields are correct, but the absence of `fraud_type` value significantly affects the satisfaction criteria."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Bounced Cheque"".
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction object.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output (""POLICEREF1"").

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output (""District Investigation Team 4"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format (""2025-01-03"").
  - `amount`: Present but lacks the currency unit (HKD). The predicted output has ""20000"" instead of ""20000 HKD"". This is a minor formatting issue.
  - `from`:
    - `account_number`: Correct (""444-4444444-103"").
    - `bank`: Correct (""BOC"").
  - `to`:
    - `account_number`: Correct (""111-111111-101"").
    - `name`: Correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").

- **Summary:**
  - The predicted output is mostly correct, with the exception of the missing currency unit in the `amount` field. All other fields and their values are accurately represented.

**Evaluation Output:**

```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is almost entirely correct, except for the missing currency unit in the 'amount' field."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

This evaluation reflects that the overall structure and content are accurate, with a minor formatting issue noted.","### Evaluation:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match the reference output semantically. The 'amount' in the transaction lacks the currency symbol 'HKD'. All other fields and structures are correctly aligned."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
  - `fraud_type`: The predicted value ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"" does not match the reference value ""Bounced Cheque"" semantically.
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array containing one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference value.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference value.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted.
  - `amount`: Present but missing the currency symbol ""HKD"". This is a minor formatting difference, which affects the semantic correctness.
  - `from` and `to` objects: Both present and correctly structured with matching details.
  
The overall structure and most details are correct, but the discrepancy in `fraud_type` and the missing currency symbol in `amount` lead to a deduction in the score."

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**

3. **Global Optional Fields**
   - `police_team`: Present but slightly different wording. The predicted output includes ""Yuen Long District"" which is additional information compared to the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format.
   - `amount`: Present but without the currency symbol. The reference output specifies ""HK$"", which is missing in the predicted output.

Please be informed of a case of **""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service""** reported on **2024-12-05** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 4 ■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary
| Ref. | Beneficiary Bank | Layer | Beneficiary Account No. | Beneficiary Account Name |

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Present and mostly correct, but contains an additional reference ""ESPS ■■/2025"" which does not appear in the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""DIT 2 ■■■■■■"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - Each transaction has all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`, `to`) and their subfields (`name`, `account_number`, `bank`).
   - All values are correctly aligned with the reference output.

### Deductions:
- The inclusion of the additional police reference ""ESPS ■■/2025"" in `police_reference` introduces an inconsistency compared to the reference output.

### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output includes an additional police reference 'ESPS ■■/2025' which is not present in the reference output. All other fields are correctly aligned."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

The overall score is slightly reduced due to the additional police reference, but the core information and structure are correct.","### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (`""ADCC""`).
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correctly expresses the same meaning (`""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)""`).
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with four transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output except for an additional police reference (`""ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)""` vs `""KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)""`). This discrepancy will affect the score.
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (`""DIT 2 ■■■■■■""`).

3. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction contains `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to` objects.
     - Dates are in a recognizable format.
     - Amounts include both currency and numeric values.
     - `from` and `to` objects contain `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`.
       - The bank names are consistent (`HSB`).

4. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output includes all necessary fields and has a correct structure.
   - The `police_reference` contains an extra reference which is not present in the reference output.
   - The transactions are mostly correct, but there are some discrepancies in the `to` accounts' details.

### Score Breakdown:
- **Global Required Fields**: All correct.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: Slight discrepancy in `police_reference`.
- **Transactions**: 
  - 3 out of 4 transactions have the correct `to` account details.
  - One transaction has incorrect `to` account details (`""to"": {""name"": ""CHUNG SIU"", ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"", ""bank"": ""HSB""}` instead of `""to"": {""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"", ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"", ""bank"": ""HSB""}`).

### Final Evaluation:

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP TSANG ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are present and correctly formatted.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: `police_reference` is present and correctly formatted.
- **Global Optional Fields**: `police_team` is present and correctly formatted.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
  - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value.
  - `from`: Contains `account_number` and `bank`. The bank name is consistent between the predicted and correct outputs (""Heng Sang Bank"").
  - `to`: Contains `name` and `account_number`. The `bank` field is not present in either output, so it’s not evaluated.
  - `channel`: Not present in either output, so it’s not evaluated.

The only difference is the order of `name` and `account_number` within the `to` object, which does not impact the correctness of the data. Therefore, the predicted output is considered satisfactory and fully correct.","### Evaluation:

   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 3"").

     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""222-222222-101"").
     - `bank`: Present and correct (""Heng Sang Bank"").
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Present and correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
     - `bank`: Present in the predicted output but missing in the reference output. This is an extra field, so it does not negatively impact the score.

### Score Breakdown:
- The `fraud_type` field does not match semantically, which is a significant error.
- All other fields are either present or correctly formatted.
- There is one transaction, and it is mostly correct except for the extra `bank` field in the `to` object.

### Final Evaluation:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' field does not match semantically with the reference output. Additionally, there is an extra 'bank' field in the 'to' object within the transaction details."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects the minor issues identified while recognizing that most of the data is correctly captured."

}","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""** reported on **2024-09-03** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 5-■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary
| Ref. | Beneficiary Bank | Layer | Beneficiary Account No. | Beneficiary Account Name |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here's the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Search Warrant"".
   - `fraud_type`: The predicted output contains a more detailed description (""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""), which still conveys the same meaning as the reference output (""Obtaining Property By Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an empty array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` are all present and match the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team` is present in both the predicted and reference outputs and matches correctly.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - There are no transactions listed in either the predicted or correct outputs, so this section does not apply.

Given the above points, the predicted output meets all the necessary criteria and aligns with the reference output. The slight difference in the `fraud_type` description does not affect the semantic meaning.

### Evaluation Output:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

**Is Satisfactory:** true  
**Score:** 1.0  
**Reason:** The predicted output correctly includes all required and conditionally required fields, matches the semantic meaning of the `fraud_type`, and has a valid JSON structure. There are no discrepancies between the predicted and correct outputs.  
**Number of Transactions Total:** 0  
**Number of Transactions Correct:** 0  

### Detailed Assessment
- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Search Warrant"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"" vs. ""Obtaining Property By Deception"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an empty array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct.
  - `writ_no`: Present and correct.
  - `contact_person`: Present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - `police_team`: Present and correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - No transactions present, so this section does not apply.

Given that all required fields are correctly present and the semantic meaning of `fraud_type` is preserved, the predicted output is satisfactory and achieves a perfect score."

  - `source`: Present and correct (""Victim ODFT"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Impersonation"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction object.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-09-11"").
  - `amount`: Present but missing the currency symbol in the reference output. However, the numeric value matches.
  - `from`: Present as an empty object, which is acceptable if there's no information in the reference.
  - `to`: 
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
    - `name`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the reference (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
  - `channel`: Present and correct (""Others"").

### Deductions:
- The `amount` field in the predicted output includes ""HKD"" which is not present in the reference, but this minor difference is acceptable.
- The `to.name` field is missing in the predicted output, which is a significant omission since it is present in the reference.

### Score Calculation:
- The overall structure and most fields are correctly captured.
- The missing `to.name` field impacts the accuracy negatively.

Given these considerations:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to.name' field is missing in the predicted output, which is present in the reference."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects that while the majority of the fields are correctly identified and structured, the absence of a critical field (`to.name`) leads to a deduction in the overall satisfaction and score."

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number

- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.
