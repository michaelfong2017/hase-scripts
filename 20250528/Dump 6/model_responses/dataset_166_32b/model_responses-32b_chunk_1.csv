Internal Referral,8,"You are given the content of an Internal Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".

  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

  ""source"": ""HSBC Referral"",
  ""fraud_type"": ""Impersonation (Others)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

### Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Extracted from the letter as ""Investment Scam"".

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Extracted as ""POLICEREF1"".
   
3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Extracted as ""District Investigation Team 4, Yuen Long District"".

4. **Per-Transaction Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to`.

5. **Per-Transaction Conditional Fields**:
   - `from` and `to` objects include fields such as `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`. Note that ""HSB"" is normalized to ""HASE"" if present, but in this case, no such normalization was needed.

6. **Omission and Normalization Rules**:
   - Fields not present in the input are omitted.

This JSON structure captures all relevant fields from the Police Letter case content."
HSBC Referral,47,"You are given the content of an HSBC Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

### Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Set to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Set to ""Phishing Scam"".

2. **Per-Transaction Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes the `amount` field.

3. **Per-Transaction Conditional Fields**:
   - For the first transaction:
     - `date`: Present and set to ""2025-01-03"".
     - `from`: Contains `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`. The `bank` field is normalized from ""HSBC"" to ""HASE"".
     - `to`: Contains `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`. The `bank` field is already ""HASE"".

4. **Omission and Normalization Rules**:
   - Fields that are not present in the input are omitted.
   - The `bank` field is normalized from ""HSBC"" to ""HASE"" where applicable.

This JSON structure adheres to the specified rules and extracts all available fields for each transaction."
Victim ODFT,20,"You are given the content of a Victim ODFT case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""Victim ODFT"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

  ""alerted_transactions"": [
