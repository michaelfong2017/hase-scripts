- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Must always be ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Must exactly match the original input fraud type.
- alerted_transactions: Must be present as an array (can be empty, but never omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction in the alerted_transactions array must include:
- amount: Must include currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
Extract and include the following fields only if present in the input. Omit them entirely if missing or unknown.
- date: Format must be YYYY-MM-DD.
- from: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- to: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- channel: Optional string (e.g., ""FPS"", ""cash""). Only include if explicitly present.

4. Bank Name Normalization:
Normalize the values in from.bank and to.bank according to the following rules:
- ""HSB"" _ ""HASE""
- ""Hang Seng Bank"" _ ""HASE""
- ""HSBC"" and ""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation"" _ ""HSBC""

5. Omission and Formatting Rules:
- Do not include any fields that are missing or unknown in the original input.
- Do not include null, ""unknown"", or placeholders.
- Do not include extra or irrelevant fields.

6. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available valid fields from each transaction.
- Each transaction may include a different subset of fields depending on what is present in the input.

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction in the alerted_transactions array must include:
- amount: Must include currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP SO ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■
