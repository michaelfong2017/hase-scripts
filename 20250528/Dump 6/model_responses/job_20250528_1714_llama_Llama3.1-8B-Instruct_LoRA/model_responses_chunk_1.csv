HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
Money Laundering Reporting Officer
Hang Seng Bank Ltd
Financial Crime Investigations

Hong Kong

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you in connection with the following bank account, which is believed to be held with your institution. Information received by the Hong Kong Polive indicated that the below account:-

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Yours faithfully,

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.
