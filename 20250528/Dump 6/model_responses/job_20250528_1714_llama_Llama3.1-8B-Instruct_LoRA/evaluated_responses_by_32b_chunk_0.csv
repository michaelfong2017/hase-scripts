1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:

  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Internal Referral"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""External Fraud"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correct (""2025-01-04"").
   - `amount`: Correct (""HKD 45,500.00"").
   - `from`:
     - `name`: Incorrect (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"" vs ""CHAN TAI MAN"").
     - `account_number`: Incorrect (""FPS REF NO. FRN2025■■■■■■■■■■"" vs ""333-333333-101"").
     - `bank`: Extra field in the predicted output (""FPS""), which is not present in the reference.
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Incorrect (""HSBCHKHH■■■■■■■■■■"" vs ""CHAN TAI MAN"").
     - `account_number`: Incorrect (""HK125■■■■■■■■■■-000■■■■■■■■■■"" vs ""111-111111-101"").
     - `bank`: Extra field in the predicted output (""HSBC""), which is not present in the reference.
   - `channel`: Correct (""FPS"").

Given these discrepancies, the predicted output does not fully match the reference output, particularly in the `from` and `to` fields, leading to a lower score and the need for correction."

   - The predicted output is missing the `date` field for all transactions.
   - The `from.account_number` and `to.account_number` values do not match the reference for the first transaction.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number

- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number

- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

- **Global Required Fields:**

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**

### Summary:
- The `fraud_type` is incorrect.
- The `from.account_number` is missing.
- The `to.account_number` is misplaced; it should be under `from`.

### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation:
- The `fraud_type` being incorrect significantly impacts the overall score.
- The missing `from.account_number` and the misplaced `to.account_number` further reduce the score.
- Despite these issues, some fields like `source`, `police_reference`, `police_team`, `date`, and `amount` are correctly handled, contributing to the partial correctness score."

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""External Fraud"" (semantically correct).
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Missing in the predicted output.
  - `amount`: Correctly formatted (""HKD 77,000.00"").
  - `from`:
    - `account_number`: Correctly present (""333-333333-101"").
    - `bank`: Incorrectly formatted; it includes additional text that is not needed.
    - `name`: Missing.
  - `to`:
    - `account_number`: Incorrectly formatted (""101"" instead of ""111-111111-101"").
    - `bank`: Incorrectly formatted; it includes additional text that is not needed.
    - `name`: Missing.
  - `channel`: Correctly identified as ""FPS"".

Given these points, the overall score reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, primarily due to the missing `date` and `name` fields."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","### Evaluation

#### Analysis
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Romance Scam"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 5"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction contains:
     - `date`: Present and in a recognizable format.
     - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value.
     - `from`:
       - `name`: Present but should be `bank`.
       - `account_number`: Present and correct.
     - `to`:
       - `name`: Present and correct.
       - `account_number`: Present and correct.

#### Score Calculation
- The `fraud_type` is incorrect, which significantly impacts the overall score.
- The structure and content of transactions are mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the `from` object where `name` is used instead of `bank`.

Given these observations, the evaluation is as follows:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The fraud_type is incorrect ('Money Laundering' vs 'Romance Scam'). Additionally, the 'from' object in transactions uses 'name' instead of 'bank'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

The score reflects that while the majority of the fields and structures are correct, the critical error in `fraud_type` and the minor structural discrepancy in the `from` object reduce the overall satisfaction.","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here is the evaluation:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output has the correct structure and most of the necessary fields, but there are discrepancies in 'fraud_type' and the formatting of 'amount'. Additionally, the key 'account_name' in the 'to' object should be 'name'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect (Predicted: ""Money Laundering"", Reference: ""Romance Scam""). This significantly affects the score since the type of fraud must be accurately captured.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Correct (""District Investigation Team 5"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted in all transactions.
   - `amount`: Missing currency symbol (HK$). This is a minor issue, but it does affect the overall accuracy.
   - `from` and `to` objects:
     - `from.bank`: Correctly matched.
     - `from.account_number`: Correctly matched.
     - `to.account_number`: Correctly matched.
     - `to.name`: Predicted uses `account_name` instead of `name`. This is incorrect and affects the score.
   
5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The structure and presence of fields are mostly correct, except for the issues mentioned above.
   - Semantic matching is good, except for the `fraud_type`.
   - Minor formatting issues with `amount` and `to` object key names.

Given these points, the overall score is reduced due to the incorrect `fraud_type` and minor formatting issues, but the transactions themselves are structurally correct."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields

- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields

  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an empty array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` are all present and correctly formatted.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: This field exists in the reference output but is missing from the predicted output. Since this is optional, its absence does not invalidate the prediction but slightly affects the score.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - Not applicable since there are no transactions listed.

### Score Breakdown:
- **Field Presence**: All required fields are present.
- **Semantic Accuracy**: The values match semantically.
- **Optional Field Omission**: The omission of `police_team` results in a minor deduction.

}","Based on the provided reference output and the predicted output, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""Minor date format discrepancy and inclusion of unnecessary 'channel' field in transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 3,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 3
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Phishing Scam"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array containing three transactions.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - **Date**: The predicted output uses the format ""05 Jan 2025"" while the reference uses ""2025-01-05"". Both formats are recognizable, so this minor difference is acceptable.
   - **Amount**: Matches exactly between the predicted and reference outputs.
   - **From**:
     - `name`: Matches correctly.
     - `account_number`: Matches correctly.
     - `bank`: Matches correctly, including full name.
   - **To**:
     - `name`: Matches correctly.
     - `account_number`: Matches correctly.
     - `bank`: Matches correctly, including full name.
   - **Channel**: This field is present in the predicted output but is empty and optional. It does not affect the correctness since it does not conflict with the reference.

### Summary:
The predicted output is structurally correct and semantically aligned with the reference output. The only discrepancies are the date format and the inclusion of an optional `channel` field, which do not significantly impact the overall accuracy. Therefore, the predicted output is considered satisfactory with a high score.","### Evaluation

#### Global Required Fields
- **source**: Correct (""HSBC Referral"").
- **fraud_type**: Correct (""Phishing Scam"").
- **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array with the correct number of transactions.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields
- **date**: The format in the predicted output is `05 Jan 2024` while the correct format is `2025-01-05`. This is a minor format variation, but the year is incorrect.
- **amount**: Correct and matches the reference output.
- **from** and **to** objects:
  - **name**: Correctly matches the reference output.
  - **account_number**: Correctly matches the reference output.
  - **bank**: Correctly matches the reference output, with ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" being an accepted abbreviation.
- **channel**: Not present in either output, which is acceptable since it is optional.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- All global required fields are present and correctly formatted.
- Most per-transaction conditionally required fields are correct, except for the date format and year mismatch.
- The predicted output is valid JSON.

Given the above points, the evaluation score and feedback are as follows:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.85,
  ""reason"": ""The date format is slightly different and the year is incorrect in all transactions. Otherwise, the data matches well."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 3,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 3
}
```

The score reflects the high degree of accuracy but penalizes the date discrepancies."

}","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""** reported on **2024-09-03** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 5-■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""). The semantic meaning matches.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and contains one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Present, but the predicted value does not fully match the reference value. The predicted value is less detailed compared to the reference value.
   
3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present and mostly correct. The predicted value ""DIT 5"" is a subset of the reference value ""DIT 5-■■■■■■■"".

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `date`: Present and correct (""2024-07-25"").
   - `amount`: Present and correct (""135524 HKD""). The currency and numeric value match, though the order differs slightly.
   - `from`:
     - `name`: Present and correct (""TSANG SIU MING"").
     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""66666666602"").
     - `bank`: Present and correct (""HSBC""). This is acceptable since ""HSBC"" and ""HSB"" are recognized as the same institution.
   - `to`:
     - `bank`: Present and correct (""HSB"").
     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
     - `account_name`: Present, but the key should be `name`. The value is correct (""CHAN TAI MAN""), but the key mismatch is noted.
   - `channel`: Present, but it's optional and not required to match exactly.

### Summary:
- The predicted output has some discrepancies in the `police_reference` and `police_team` fields.
- There is a minor issue with the `to` object where the key `account_name` should be `name`.

### Evaluation Output:

The overall structure and most values are correct, but there are some key mismatches and less detailed information in certain fields. Hence, the score reflects partial correctness.","### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly expressed as ""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly formatted.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2024-07-25"".
   - `amount`: Slight difference in formatting (""135524 HKD"" vs ""HKD 135524""), but semantically correct.
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Correctly provided.
     - `account_name`: Provided under `account_name` instead of `name`. This is a minor inconsistency.
   - `to`:
     - `beneficiary_account_name`: Provided under `beneficiary_account_name` instead of `name`.
     - `beneficiary_account_no`: Provided under `beneficiary_account_no` instead of `account_number`.
     - `beneficiary_bank`: Provided under `beneficiary_bank` instead of `bank`. This is a minor inconsistency.
   - `channel`: Present but not required; it does not affect the overall correctness.

### Evaluation Summary:
The predicted output is largely satisfactory. There are some minor inconsistencies in field naming within the `from` and `to` objects, but these do not significantly impact the overall correctness of the data.

**Evaluation Output:**

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,

### Evaluation:
- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Search Warrant"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Obtaining Property By Deception"" vs ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an empty array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct.
  - `writ_no`: Present and correct.
  - `contact_person`: Present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - Not applicable since there are no transactions listed.

### Score Breakdown:
- All required fields are present and correctly formatted.
- The `fraud_type` field has slightly different wording but conveys the same meaning.
- All conditionally required fields are present and correct.
- No transactions are listed in either output, so there is nothing to evaluate per transaction.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""External Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **First Transaction:**
     - `date`: The format is slightly different (""20250103"" vs ""2025-01-03""), but still recognizable.
     - `amount`: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 64,348.00"".
     - `from`:
       - `name`: Incorrect (""UB■■■■■■■■"" vs ""XIE PANGAN"").
       - `account_number`: Missing in the prediction.
     - `to`:
       - `name`: Correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
       - `account_number`: Mismatched (""024■■■■■■■■"" vs ""111-111111-101"").
     - `channel`: Unnecessary additional detail.
   
   - **Second Transaction:**
     - This transaction does not exist in the reference output, making it extraneous.

3. **Summary:**
   - The global required fields are correctly handled.
   - The transaction details do not fully align with the reference output, particularly in the names and account numbers.
   - The inclusion of an extra transaction and the `channel` field in the predicted output introduces inaccuracies.

Given these discrepancies, the overall score is 0.6, reflecting partial correctness while acknowledging significant errors in transaction details."

Based on the provided predicted output and the correct reference output, here's the assessment:

#### Guidelines Check:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Search Warrant"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correct. The predicted output provides a more detailed description (""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""), which still matches the semantic meaning of the reference output (""Obtaining Property By Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array (empty in this case).

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct.
   - `writ_no`: Present and correct.
   - `contact_person`: Present and correct.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct, as it exists in the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Not applicable since there are no transactions listed in either output.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- All required fields are present and correctly structured.
- Values match semantically, even though the `fraud_type` has additional legal context.
- The predicted output is valid JSON.

#### Score Breakdown:
- The predicted output is entirely consistent with the reference output.
- There are no discrepancies in the required fields or their values.
- No transactions were specified in either output, so the empty `alerted_transactions` array is correctly handled.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output fully matches the reference output in terms of field presence, structure, and semantic accuracy."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

This indicates that the predicted output is perfectly aligned with the reference output."

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Victim ODFT"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Impersonation"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: The date format in the predicted output is ""9月11日"", which is not a standard international format. The reference uses ""2024-09-11"". This is a minor issue.
   - `amount`: The predicted output has ""98000"" while the reference has ""980000"". There is a discrepancy in the amount.
   - `from` and `to` objects:
     - The `from` object in the predicted output contains ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"" fields, while the reference does not have a `from` object at all. This is incorrect.
     - The `to` object in the predicted output contains ""name"" and ""bank"" fields, while the reference only includes ""name"" and ""account_number"". The inclusion of ""bank"" is incorrect, and the missing ""account_number"" is also incorrect.
   - `channel`: The predicted output has ""转账"" (which translates to ""transfer""), while the reference has ""Others"". These do not semantically match.

### Summary:
- The global required fields are correctly included.
- There are discrepancies in the transaction details:
  - Date format is non-standard.
  - Amount is incorrect.
  - The `from` object is incorrectly included.
  - The `to` object is missing an important field and includes an incorrect one.
  - Channel does not semantically match.

### Evaluation Output:
```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0

The score reflects partial correctness due to the inclusion of some fields and the general structure being correct, but significant errors in the transaction details.","### Evaluation:

#### Global Required Fields:
- **Source**: Correct (""Victim ODFT"").
- **Fraud Type**: Correct (""Impersonation"").
- **Alerted Transactions**: Present and contains one transaction object.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
- **Date**: Correct (""2024-09-11"").
- **Amount**: Incomplete. The amount should include both currency and numeric value. Here it only has the numeric value.
- **From**: Incorrect. The reference does not have a ""from"" section, and the ""to"" section contains the account number instead.
- **To**: Incorrect. The name in the reference is ""CHAN TAI MAN"", and the account number should be under the ""to"" section.
- **Channel**: Incorrect. The channel in the reference is ""Others"", while the prediction states ""转账"".

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Field Presence and Structure**: Some fields are misplaced or missing (currency in amount, incorrect ""from"" and ""to"" details).
- **Values Matching Semantically**: The date matches correctly, but other fields have discrepancies.
- **Fraud Type**: Matches semantically.
- **Bank Names/Aliases**: Not applicable here.

#### Deductions:
- Amount missing currency information.
- Misplaced ""account_number"" in ""from"" instead of ""to"".
- Incorrect name in ""to"".
- Incorrect channel.

### Final Assessment:

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Evaluation:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Incorrect meaning (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Telephone Deception"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and non-empty.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-05-22"").
  - `amount`: Present and correct (""3000 HKD"" vs ""3000-HKD"").
  - `from`: Present and contains `name` and `account_number`.
    - `name`: Present and correct (""Hang Seng Bank"").
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""222-222222-101"").
  - `to`: Present and contains `name` and `account_number`.
    - `name`: Present and correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
  - `channel`: Present in the predicted output but absent in the reference output.

### Score Breakdown:
- The `fraud_type` is incorrect, which is a significant issue.
- All other fields are either correctly present or have minor formatting issues that do not affect the semantic meaning.
- The presence of the `channel` field in the predicted output while it is absent in the reference output is a minor inconsistency.

### Final Evaluation:

This score reflects the major discrepancy in the `fraud_type` and minor issues in formatting and additional fields.","Based on the provided reference output and the predicted output, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").

   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correct (""2024-05-22"").
   - `amount`: Present but slightly different format (""3000 HKD"" vs ""3000-HKD""). However, this difference is minor and acceptable.
   - `from` and `to` objects: Both present and mostly correct, with slight differences in key names (""account_name"" vs ""name"") which are acceptable given the context.

### Deductions:
- The `fraud_type` is significantly different and incorrect, which impacts the overall accuracy.
- Minor discrepancies in `amount` format and `to` object key names do not severely impact the overall structure and content.

### Final Assessment:

```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,

- **Score**: 0.8 (out of 1.0)
- **Reason**: The primary reason for the deduction is the incorrect `fraud_type`. Other fields are mostly correct with minor formatting differences."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect meaning (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Bounced Cheque"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2025-01-03"").
   - `amount`: Present but missing currency unit (""20000"" vs ""20000 HKD"").
   - `from`: Present and contains the required fields (`bank` and `account_number`).
     - `bank`: Correct (""BOC"").
     - `account_number`: Correct (""444-4444444-103"").
   - `to`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the correct output.
   - `channel`: Present in the predicted output but absent in the correct output. This is an optional field, so its presence does not affect the correctness.

### Evaluation Summary:
- The `fraud_type` is incorrect.
- The `amount` is missing the currency unit.
- The `to` object is missing entirely in the predicted output.
- Other fields are mostly correct.

### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""Incorrect 'fraud_type', missing currency in 'amount', and missing 'to' object in transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, considering the significant issues with `fraud_type`, `amount`, and the missing `to` object.","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here is the evaluation:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.65,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output has some discrepancies: incorrect 'fraud_type', missing currency in 'amount', and incomplete 'from' and 'to' details."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect; it states ""Money Laundering"" instead of ""Bounced Cheque"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and contains one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Correctly present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `date`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference output.
   - `amount`: Missing currency (HKD). Only the numeric value is provided.
   - `from`: 
     - `account_number`: Correct.
     - `bank`: Missing. Reference output includes ""BOC"".
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Missing. Reference output includes ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - `account_number`: Correct.
   - `channel`: Optional and provided, but not present in the reference output.

Given these discrepancies, the predicted output is not fully satisfactory. The `fraud_type` being incorrect significantly impacts the overall accuracy, and several transaction details are either missing or incorrectly formatted. Therefore, the score reflects partial correctness with notable errors."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted.
   - `amount`: Present but slightly different format (""50000 HKD"" vs ""HK$50000""). This difference is minor and acceptable.
   - `from`: Present but includes an unexpected `account_number` (""NA CASH"") which doesn't match the reference output (no `from` object).
   - `to`: Missing in both the predicted and reference outputs, so no issue here.
   - `channel`: Present but with a different value (""NA CASH"" vs ""RTGS""). This is a notable discrepancy.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output has a significant issue with `fraud_type`.
   - The transaction details have some minor formatting differences but mostly correct.

**Global Required Fields:**
- **Source:** Present and correct (""ADCC"").
- **Fraud Type:** Present and semantically correct (""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"").
- **Alerted Transactions:** Present as an array with one transaction.

**Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
- **Police Reference:** Present and correct.

**Global Optional Fields:**
- **Police Team:** Present and correct.

**Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
- **Date:** Present and correct (""2024-12-03"").
- **Amount:** Present but slightly different format (""144123 HKD"" vs ""HKD 144123""). This minor difference is acceptable.
- **From:**
  - **Name:** Present and correct (""CHEUNG TAK SHING"").
  - **Account Number:** Present and correct (""444-4444444-101"").
  - **Bank:** Missing in the predicted output, which is incorrect.
- **To:**
  - **Name:** Present but under a different key (`beneficiary_account_name` instead of `name`). This is incorrect.
  - **Account Number:** Present but under a different key (`beneficiary_account_no` instead of `account_number`). This is incorrect.
  - **Bank:** Present but under a different key (`beneficiary_bank` instead of `bank`). This is incorrect.
- **Channel:** Present but the value ""NO STR"" does not correspond to any expected value in the correct output, making it incorrect.

**Evaluation Summary:**

- The predicted output has some discrepancies in the transaction details, particularly in the keys used for the `to` object and the missing `bank` field in the `from` object.
- There are minor acceptable differences in the amount formatting.
- The presence of the `channel` field with an unexpected value reduces the overall accuracy.

**Final Assessment:**

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output has issues with the 'from' object missing the 'bank' field, and the 'to' object using incorrect keys ('beneficiary_account_name', 'beneficiary_account_no', 'beneficiary_bank') instead of the correct ones ('name', 'account_number', 'bank'). Additionally, the 'channel' field has an unexpected value."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

This score reflects the partial correctness and the significant discrepancies in the transaction details.","### Evaluation:

- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-12-03"").
  - `amount`: Present and semantically correct (""144123 HKD"" vs ""HKD 144123""). Minor formatting difference is acceptable.
  - `from`:
    - `name`: Present and correct.
    - `account_number`: Present and correct.
    - `bank`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the correct output.
  - `to`:
    - `name`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the correct output.
    - `account_number`: Present and correct.
    - `bank`: Present and correct.
  - `channel`: Present in the predicted output but not in the correct output. This is optional and does not affect the overall correctness.

### Deductions:
- The `from.bank` field is missing in the predicted output.
- The `to.name` field is missing in the predicted output.

### Score Calculation:
- Total fields to check: 13 (source, fraud_type, police_reference, police_team, alerted_transactions, date, amount, from.name, from.account_number, from.bank, to.name, to.account_number, to.bank)
- Correct fields: 11 (all except `from.bank` and `to.name`)
- Score: \( \frac{11}{13} = 0.846 \)

### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.846,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'from.bank' and 'to.name' fields in the transaction details."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The predicted output is largely satisfactory but has minor omissions in the transaction details."

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"" (semantically matching the reference).
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference.
  - `amount`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference.
  - `from` and `to` objects: All subfields (`name`, `account_number`, `bank`) match the reference.
  - `channel`: Present in the predicted output but optional and does not affect correctness.

Since all required fields are correctly present and the values match semantically, the predicted output is considered satisfactory with a perfect score.","{

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

#### Global Required Fields:
- **source**: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
- **fraud_type**: Correctly expresses the same meaning (""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)""). 
- **alerted_transactions**: Present and correctly formatted as an array.

#### Global Conditionally Required Fields:
- **police_reference**: Present, but contains an additional reference ""ESPS ■■/2025"" which is not in the correct output. This introduces inconsistency.

#### Global Optional Fields:
- **police_team**: Present and matches the correct output.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
- **date**: Correct format and values.
- **amount**: Correct values, but formatting is slightly different (currency symbol position). This is acceptable per the guidelines.
- **from** and **to**: All sub-fields (name, account_number, bank) are present and correct.
- **channel**: Present in the predicted output but absent in the correct output. This is an unnecessary inclusion.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Field presence and structure**: Mostly aligned with the reference output, except for the extra reference in `police_reference` and the unnecessary `channel` field.
- **Values**: Match semantically, with acceptable minor formatting differences.
- **Fraud type**: Matches semantically.
- **Bank names**: Correctly matched.
- **Transactions**: All transactions have correct data, but there is an issue with the order of transactions.

#### Score Calculation:
- **Field presence and structure**: Deduct 0.1 for the extra reference in `police_reference`.
- **Unnecessary fields**: Deduct 0.1 for the `channel` field.
- **Transaction order**: Deduct 0.1 for the incorrect order of transactions.

Total deductions: 0.3

Final score: 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7

#### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.7,
  ""reason"": ""Extra reference in 'police_reference', unnecessary 'channel' field, and incorrect order of transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

The predicted output is mostly satisfactory, but there are minor issues that affect the overall score.","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here is the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correctly expresses the same meaning (""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present but contains additional information compared to the reference. The core reference number (`KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)`) is correct.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value, though formatting slightly differs.
   - `from` and `to`: Present and contain `name` and `account_number`. However, the `bank` field is missing.
   
5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output has some transactions that do not match the reference transactions (e.g., extra transactions involving different `to` accounts).
   - The `bank` field is missing in all transactions, which is a significant issue since it is conditionally required if present in the reference.
   - Date and amount values are generally correct but some transactions have incorrect dates and amounts.

### Evaluation Summary:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.7,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output has several discrepancies including extra transactions, missing 'bank' fields, and some incorrect date and amount values."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 5,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 2
}
```

**Explanation**:
- **Score**: 0.7 because while the global structure and most fields are correct, there are notable issues with missing `bank` fields and some transactions being incorrect or extraneous.
- **Reason**: The predicted output includes additional transactions not present in the reference and lacks the `bank` field, which is required if present in the reference.
- **Number of Transactions**: Total 5 transactions were predicted, but only 2 match the reference transactions accurately."

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match semantically. The 'from' object is missing the 'bank' field."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Telephone Deception""). This is a significant mismatch in meaning.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and contains one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Correctly included and matches the reference.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Correctly included and matches the reference.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference.
   - `amount`: Correct, minor formatting difference (with comma) is acceptable.
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Correct.
     - `bank`: Missing in the predicted output, which is incorrect since it exists in the reference.
   - `to`:
     - `account_number`: Correct.
     - `name`: Correct.
   - `channel`: Present in the predicted output but not in the reference, so this is an extra field and not a requirement.

### Summary:
- The `fraud_type` is a critical mismatch.
- The `from` object is missing the `bank` field, which is required when present in the reference.
- The rest of the fields match well, including dates, amounts, and account numbers.

Given these points, the overall score reflects the significant semantic error in `fraud_type` and the missing required field in the transaction details.","### Evaluation:

#### Assessment:
1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present but incorrect (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Telephone Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 3"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-06-29"").
   - `amount`: Present and correct (""25500 HKD"" vs ""HK$25500""). Slight formatting difference is acceptable.
   - `from`: Present with correct `account_number` and `bank`.
   - `to`: Present with correct `account_number` and `name`.
   - `channel`: Present but not in the reference output, which is optional and does not affect the score negatively.

#### Score Breakdown:
- **Field presence and structure:** All required fields are present and structured correctly.
- **Values:** Most values match semantically except for `fraud_type`, which significantly impacts the overall accuracy.
- **Fraud type mismatch:** This is a critical error since the fraud type is different from the reference.

Given these points, the output is mostly correct but fails due to the significant discrepancy in the `fraud_type`.

#### Final Evaluation:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' is incorrect ('Money Laundering' instead of 'Telephone Deception'), which significantly impacts the overall accuracy."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The transactions are correctly captured, but the `fraud_type` error lowers the overall score."

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are correctly present and appropriately structured.
- **Fraud Type**: The `fraud_type` is correctly identified as ""External Fraud"" in both the predicted and reference outputs.
- **Transactions**: Both transactions are present in the predicted output and match the amounts in the reference output. However, the predicted output includes additional fields (`date`, `from`, `to`, `channel`) which were not present in the reference output. This deviation from the reference structure affects the overall correctness and leads to a lower score.
- **Structure and Presence**: The presence and structure of the fields are mostly correct, except for the inclusion of unnecessary fields within the transactions, which reduces the score.

Overall, while the core information is accurate, the extra fields not aligned with the reference reduce the satisfaction level and score.","{

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  - `from`: Contains all expected fields (`name`, `account_number`, `bank`). The values match the reference.
  - `to`: Contains all expected fields (`name`, `account_number`, `bank`). The values match the reference.
  - `channel`: Not present in either output, which is acceptable since it's optional.

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""HSBC Referral"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""UAP-Impersonation (Other)""). The meaning matches.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correct (""2024-07-10"").
   - `amount`: Correct (""HKD1.00"").
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Correct (""666-66666-601"").
     - `bank`: Correct (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
     - Missing `name` (""YEUNG KAI"").
   - `to`:
     - `account_number`: Correct (""111-111111-101"").
     - `bank`: Correct (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
     - Missing `name` (""CHAN TAI MAN"").

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The structure and presence of fields are mostly correct.
   - The missing `name` fields in both `from` and `to` sections result in partial correctness.

### Score Calculation:
- Total number of transactions: 1
- Number of transactions correct: 0.5 (since some fields are missing)

Given the missing `name` fields, the score is reduced accordingly.

### Final Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'name' fields are missing in both 'from' and 'to' sections of the transaction."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0.5
}
```

The predicted output is largely correct but lacks the `name` fields which are conditionally required based on the reference output. Hence, it receives a satisfactory score with a reason for the deduction."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Evaluation

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""External Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format (""2025-01-04"").
   - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HKD 40,012.00"").
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Present but incorrect (""111-111111-101"" vs ""555-555555-101"").
     - `name`: Missing in the predicted output.
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Present but slightly different (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" vs ""CHAN TAI MAN"").
     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
   - `channel`: Missing in the predicted output.

### Deductions
- The `from` section is missing the `name` field and has an incorrect `account_number`.
- The `to` section has a minor discrepancy in the `name` field.
- The `channel` field is missing entirely.

### Scores and Reasoning
- The overall structure and presence of required fields are satisfactory.
- There are some minor discrepancies and missing fields, which impact the accuracy.

### Final Assessment
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' section is missing the 'name' field and has an incorrect 'account_number'. The 'to' section has a minor discrepancy in the 'name' field. The 'channel' field is missing."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

This score reflects that while the structure and many fields are correct, there are significant errors in the details of the transaction data."

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you in connection with the following bank account, which is believed to be held with your institution. Information received by the Hong Kong Polive indicated that the below account:-

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","Based on the provided reference output and the predicted output, here's the evaluation:

### Evaluation:
- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Incorrect (""Money Laundering"" vs ""Investment Scam"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and structured correctly.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Correct (""2024-07-26"").
  - `amount`: Slightly incorrect due to formatting (""HK$10,000"" vs ""HK$10000"").
  - `from`:
    - `bank`: Correct (""CCB"").
    - `account_number`: Missing in the predicted output.
  - `to`:
    - `account_number`: Present but incorrect (""66666666601"" vs ""111-111111-101"").
    - `name`: Missing in the predicted output.
  - `channel`: Not present in either output, so this is fine.

### Deductions:
- The `fraud_type` is incorrect, which is a significant error.
- The `amount` has minor formatting issues.
- The `from.account_number` and `to.name` are missing, which impacts the completeness of the transaction details.

### Score Calculation:
- **Field Presence and Structure**: Mostly correct, but some key details are missing or incorrect.
- **Values Matching Semantically**: Significant mismatch in `fraud_type`.
- **Bank Names**: Correctly matched.

Given these points, the overall score would be lower due to the critical errors in `fraud_type` and missing transaction details.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' is incorrect, 'from.account_number' and 'to.name' are missing, and there are minor formatting issues with the 'amount'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0

This score reflects the significant errors and omissions, despite the correct presence of other fields."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

Note that the ""to"" field in the JSON output has ""account_number"" as ""to-be-determined"" because the actual recipient account number is not provided in the input.","### Evaluation

**Global Required Fields:**
- **Source:** Correct (""Victim ODFT"").
- **Fraud Type:** Correct (""Impersonation"").
- **Alerted Transactions:** Present as an array with two transactions.

**Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
- Each transaction contains the fields `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `channel`.
  - **Date:** The year in the predicted output is incorrect (`2024` instead of `2023`). This affects the accuracy of the date.
  - **Amount:** Correct (`HKD46,000.00`).
  - **From:** Correct (`name` and `account_number`).
  - **Channel:** Correct (`Others`).
  - **To:** The `to` object is present in the predicted output but not in the correct output, making it unnecessary information.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- The date discrepancy significantly impacts the correctness of the transactions.
- The `to` field is incorrectly included in the predicted output, which does not match the correct output.

**Score Calculation:**
- There are two transactions total.
- Both transactions have minor issues due to the incorrect year in the date field.
- The inclusion of the `to` field in the predicted output introduces unnecessary information.

Given these points, the predicted output is mostly correct but has notable discrepancies.

#### Global Required Fields
- **Source**: Correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
- **Fraud Type**: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"".
- **Alerted Transactions**: Present as an array with two transactions.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields
1. **Date**:
   - Predicted: `2024-12-10`, `2024-12-11`
   - Reference: `2023-12-10`, `2023-12-11`
   - **Issue**: The year in the dates is incorrect (2024 instead of 2023).

2. **Amount**:
   - Predicted: `HKD46,000.00`
   - Reference: `HKD46,000.00`
   - **Correct**: Matches the reference.

3. **From**:
   - Predicted: 
     ```json
     {
       ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101""
     }
     ```
   - Reference: 
     ```json
     {
       ""name"": ""MR CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
       ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101""
     }
     ```
   - **Issue**: Missing the `name` field.

4. **To**:
   - Predicted:
     ```json
     {
       ""account_number"": ""to-be-determined""
     }
     ```
   - Reference: No `to` field provided.
   - **Note**: Since the reference does not provide this information, it is acceptable to have ""to-be-determined"".

5. **Channel**:
   - Predicted: `""ATM""`
   - Reference: `""Others""`
   - **Issue**: The channel is incorrect.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Field presence and structure**: Mostly aligned with the reference, except for missing `name` in `from`.
- **Values**: Date and channel values are incorrect; amount is correct.
- **Fraud_type**: Semantically correct.
- **Bank names**: Not applicable here.

#### Score Calculation
- **Number of transactions total**: 2
- **Number of transactions correct**: 0 (due to issues with date, channel, and missing `name`)

Given the issues with date, channel, and missing `name`, the output is not satisfactory.

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""The dates are incorrect, the channel is wrong, and the 'name' field under 'from' is missing. These discrepancies significantly impact the accuracy of the output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

This score reflects partial correctness due to accurate amounts and source/fraud type, but significant errors in other critical fields."
