I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP SO ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Employment Fraud"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF3"").

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Not present in the predicted output, but this is optional and not required since it was not present in the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2025-01-02"").
   - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HK$4000"").
   - `from`: Present and contains the correct fields (`account_number` and `bank`).
     - `account_number`: Correctly present and matches the reference.
     - `bank`: Correctly present and matches the reference.
   - `to`: Present but empty, which is acceptable since it was also empty in the reference.
   - `channel`: Not present in either the reference or the predicted output, so this is not an issue.

### Deductions:
- The predicted output is mostly accurate, with only minor structural differences in the order of fields within the `from` object.

### Final Assessment:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is nearly perfect with only minor structural differences in the 'from' object."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

The score reflects the high accuracy of the predicted output, with a slight deduction for the minor structural difference noted."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

1. **Global Required Fields**:

   - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Romance Scam"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 5"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction has the required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`), but the `to` field is missing in all transactions in the predicted output.

5. **Field Presence and Structure**:
   - The predicted output lacks the `to` field in all transactions, which is present in the reference output.

6. **Values Matching**:
   - Date and `from` details match correctly.
   - Amount values are present but lack the currency symbol in the predicted output. This minor formatting difference is acceptable.

Explanation:
- The overall structure and most fields are correct, hence the score is relatively high (0.75).
- The missing `to` field in all transactions impacts the completeness and accuracy, leading to a deduction in the score.
- All other required fields are present and accurate."

Explanation:
- The `source` and `fraud_type` fields are correctly identified and aligned with the reference output.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the correct number of transactions.
- Each transaction includes the `amount` field, which is correctly formatted and matches the reference.
- However, the predicted output includes additional fields (`date`, `from`, `to`) that are not present in the reference output, leading to unnecessary information and a deduction in score.","Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Internal Referral"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""External Fraud"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and structured as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - The reference only includes `amount` for each transaction, so other fields (`date`, `from`, `to`) are not necessary.
   - The `amount` field is correctly formatted and present in all transactions.

### Deductions:
- The predicted output includes additional fields (`date`, `from`, `to`) which are not present in the reference output. While these fields do not cause the output to be invalid, they are not necessary and can be considered extraneous.
- There are more transactions in the predicted output (3) compared to the reference output (2). This discrepancy is significant because the reference output specifies only two transactions.

### Score Calculation:
- Presence of global required fields: 1.0
- Accuracy of transaction data (only `amount` is relevant): 1.0
- Extraneous fields and incorrect number of transactions: -0.5

### Final Assessment:
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output includes extraneous fields (date, from, to) and an incorrect number of transactions (3 instead of 2)."",

Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are correctly present and their values match the reference output.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: Each transaction within `alerted_transactions` includes all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`, `to`). The values for these fields match the reference output, including the bank names which are correctly identified despite potential aliasing.
- **Formatting and Semantics**: The date format, amount format, and bank names are consistent between the predicted and reference outputs.
- **Transactions**: There is one transaction in both outputs, and it is correctly formatted and populated.

Given this alignment, the predicted output is fully satisfactory and receives a perfect score."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Yours faithfully,

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields are correctly included and match the reference output.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: Both `police_reference` and `police_team` are present and correct.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - **Date**: Correctly formatted and matches the reference.
  - **Amount**: Slight formatting difference (""HKD"" vs ""HK$"") but semantically equivalent.
  - **From**: Contains the correct `bank` and `account_number`.
  - **To**: Contains the correct `name`, but missing the `account_number`.

Overall, the predicted output is highly satisfactory with only minor discrepancies."

**Global Required Fields:**
- **Source:** Correctly specified as ""Victim ODFT"".
- **Fraud Type:** Correctly specified as ""Impersonation"".
- **Alerted Transactions:** Present as an array.

**Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
- Each transaction contains the fields `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `channel`. However, there are discrepancies:
  - The `account_number` field under `from` is missing in the predicted output.
  - The `channel` field values do not match (`ATM` vs `Others`).

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- The overall structure and presence of the fields are mostly correct.
- The `fraud_type` matches semantically.
- The `date` and `amount` fields are correctly formatted and match.
- The `from.name` field matches.
- The `channel` field does not match, and the `account_number` field is missing.

Given these observations, the predicted output is partially correct but lacks some crucial details.

**Evaluation Output:**

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'account_number' field is missing from the 'from' object in all transactions, and the 'channel' field values do not match the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The score reflects partial correctness due to missing and incorrect fields.
- No transaction is fully correct because of the missing `account_number` and incorrect `channel`.
- The `reason` highlights the specific issues affecting the accuracy of the output."

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you in connection with the following bank account, which is believed to be held with your institution. Information received by the Hong Kong Polive indicated that the below account:-

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case IP YUEN ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are present and correctly formatted.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: `police_reference` is present and matches the reference.
- **Global Optional Fields**: `police_team` is present and matches the reference.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to`. All sub-fields within `from` and `to` are correctly present and match the reference.
- **Field Presence and Structure**: The structure of the predicted output aligns perfectly with the reference output.
- **Values and Semantic Meaning**: All values are semantically correct and match the reference output.

Given these observations, the predicted output is fully satisfactory with no discrepancies.","### Evaluation:

- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Bounced Cheque"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and non-empty.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and in a recognizable format (""2025-01-03"").
  - `amount`: Present but missing the currency (""HKD""). This is a minor formatting issue.
  - `from`:
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""444-4444444-103"").
    - `bank`: Present and correct (""BOC"").
  - `to`:
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
    - `name`: Present and correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").

### Deductions:
- The amount field in the transaction is missing the currency symbol (""HKD""), which is a minor formatting issue.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The amount field in the transaction is missing the currency symbol ('HKD'), which is a minor formatting issue."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The overall structure and content are largely correct, with only a minor formatting issue affecting the score slightly."

   - `from`: Only the bank is provided in the predicted output (""NA CASH""), which is acceptable.
   - `to`: Not present in either output, so this is consistent.
   - `channel`: Missing in the predicted output, while it is present in the correct output (""RTGS"").

### Summary:
The predicted output is mostly correct, with some minor discrepancies noted. The key points of concern are:
- The `police_team` naming difference, which is acceptable.
- The missing `channel` in the transaction details.

Given these observations, the output is satisfactory but not perfect.

```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""Minor discrepancy in 'police_team' naming and missing 'channel' in transaction details."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

This score reflects the high degree of accuracy with a slight deduction for the missing optional field."

}","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service""** reported on **2024-12-05** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 4 ■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary
| Ref. | Beneficiary Bank | Layer | Beneficiary Account No. | Beneficiary Account Name |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Evaluation:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Correct (""ADCC"").
  - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array with one transaction object.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correctly formatted.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format (""2024-12-03"").
  - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HKD 144123"").
  - `from` and `to` objects:
    - Both have `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields.
    - `bank` values are consistent (`HSBC` and `HSB` are considered equivalent).
  - `channel`: Not present in either the reference or predicted output, which is acceptable.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": ""All required fields are present and correctly formatted. The predicted output matches the reference output in structure and semantic content."",

- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array containing one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format (""2024-12-03"").
  - `amount`: Present and includes currency and numeric value (""HKD 144123"").
  - `from`:
    - `name`: Present and correct (""CHEUNG TAK SHING"").
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""444-4444444-101"").
    - `bank`: Missing in the predicted output.
  - `to`:
    - `name`: Present and correct (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""111-111111-101"").
    - `bank`: Missing in the predicted output.

- **Overall Structure and Validity**:
  - The predicted output is valid JSON and structurally matches the reference output except for the missing `bank` fields under `from` and `to`.

### Evaluation Output:

```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.85,
  ""reason"": ""The 'bank' fields under 'from' and 'to' are missing in the predicted output."",

}
```

### Reasoning:
The overall structure and most fields are correct, but the missing `bank` fields under `from` and `to` result in a slight deduction in the score. The predicted output would be satisfactory if these fields were included."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

```","### Evaluation:

The predicted output matches the reference output in all aspects. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Both have ""ADCC"".
   - `fraud_type`: Both specify ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and structured correctly with four transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to` fields, which are all correctly formatted and match the reference output.

Given that all fields and values are correctly present and match the reference output, the evaluation result is as follows:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": ""All fields and values are correctly present and match the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

This indicates that the predicted output is fully satisfactory and accurately reflects the reference output.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output closely matches the reference output with minor discrepancies in the 'police_reference' field. The structure and content of other fields are accurate."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are correctly present and accurately filled.
- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: The `police_reference` field exists and is mostly correct, but there is a slight discrepancy in formatting. The reference includes ""KT RN"" which is missing in the predicted output.
- **Global Optional Fields**: The `police_team` field is correctly included and matches the reference output.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: Each transaction contains all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`, `to`). The values within these fields match the reference output.
- **Field Structure and Values**: The structure of the JSON is valid and the values are semantically correct, with only minor formatting issues noted.

Overall, the predicted output is satisfactory with a high degree of accuracy, leading to a score of 0.95."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""). 
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction object.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-07-25"").
  - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HKD 135524"").
  - `from`:
    - `name`: Present and correct (""TSANG SIU MING"").
    - `account_number`: Present and correct (""66666666602"").
  - `to`:

    - `bank`: Present and correct (""HSB"").

- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - All required fields are present and structured correctly.
  - Values match semantically with no discrepancies noted.
  - The predicted output is valid JSON.

Given that all fields are correctly present and the values match the reference output, the evaluation is satisfactory.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present but incomplete. The predicted output contains only part of the full reference in the correct output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted.
   - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted.
   - `from`: Present and correctly filled.
   - `to`: Present and correctly filled, except for the missing `bank` field.

### Deductions:
- The `police_reference` in the predicted output is incomplete compared to the reference output.
- The `to` object in the predicted output is missing the `bank` field.

### Scores and Reasoning:
- **Field Presence and Structure**: Most fields are present and correctly structured, except for the missing `bank` field in the `to` object and the incomplete `police_reference`.
- **Values**: Values match semantically where present, except for the missing details mentioned above.
- **Fraud Type**: Semantically correct.
- **Bank Names**: Not applicable as the `bank` field is missing.

Given these observations, the overall score is calculated as follows:
- The predicted output is mostly correct but has some missing information.
- There is one transaction, and it is partially correct.

#### Final Evaluation:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'police_reference' is incomplete, and the 'bank' field in the 'to' object is missing."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, acknowledging the presence of most required fields while noting the missing and incomplete details."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All global required fields are present and correctly formatted.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: 
  - The `date`, `amount`, `to` (with `account_number`), and `channel` fields are present and correctly formatted.
  - However, the `name` field within the `to` object is missing, which is present in the reference output.
- **Evaluation Criteria**:
  - The absence of the `name` field results in the transaction being marked as incorrect.
  - The overall score reflects partial correctness due to the missing field.","Based on the given guidelines and the provided outputs, here's the evaluation:

### Evaluation:

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Victim ODFT"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Impersonation"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and is an array.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-09-11"").
  - `amount`: Present and includes numeric value (""980000""). However, it lacks currency information.
  - `from`: Present but contains only the `name` field, which does not match the reference output where the `to` object contains the `name`.
  - `to`: Present and contains the `account_number`. However, the `name` field is missing.
  - `channel`: Present and correct (""Others"").

### Deductions:
- The `amount` field lacks currency information.
- The `from` object is incorrectly used; the `name` should be under the `to` object instead.
- The `to` object is missing the `name` field.

### Scores and Reasoning:
- The overall structure and most fields are correct, but there are significant issues with the `from` and `to` objects.
- The score reflects these inaccuracies, particularly the misplacement of the `name` field and the lack of currency in the `amount`.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""The 'amount' field lacks currency information. The 'from' object is incorrectly used; the 'name' should be under the 'to' object. The 'to' object is missing the 'name' field."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score of 0.6 reflects partial correctness, but the critical errors in transaction details prevent it from being fully satisfactory."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is mostly correct but has minor discrepancies such as the 'amount' field missing the currency symbol and the 'to' object having incorrect keys."",

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Telephone Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-05-22"").
   - `amount`: Present but missing the currency symbol (HKD). The predicted output has ""3000"" while the correct output has ""3000-HKD"". This is a minor discrepancy.
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Present and correct (""222-222222-101"").
     - `bank`: Present and correct (""Hang Seng Bank"").
   - `to`:
     - `account_number`: Incorrectly labeled as ""account_number"" instead of ""name"" (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
     - `name`: Missing in the predicted output.
     - `bank`: Incorrectly labeled as ""bank"" instead of ""account_number"" (""111-111111-101"").
   
   Despite these issues, the transaction information is largely correct, and the overall structure is maintained.

### Conclusion:
The predicted output is satisfactory with a high degree of accuracy. However, there are minor discrepancies in the `amount` and `to` object fields which slightly reduce the score."
