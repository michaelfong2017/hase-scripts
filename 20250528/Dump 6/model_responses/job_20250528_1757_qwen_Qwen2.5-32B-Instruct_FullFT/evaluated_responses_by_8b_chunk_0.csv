}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Rationale:
The predicted output is partially correct. The'source' and 'fraud_type' fields are correctly identified, and the 'alerted_transactions' array is present. However, the 'from' and 'to' fields in the first transaction are swapped in the predicted output. This discrepancy results in a score of 0.5, indicating partial correctness.","### Evaluation Output

  ""reason"": ""The 'from' and 'to' account numbers are swapped in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale

The predicted output is not entirely satisfactory due to the following reasons:

1. The field 'channel' is missing from the predicted output, which is present in the reference output.
2. The 'from' and 'to' account numbers are swapped in the predicted output, which means the 'from' account is actually the recipient and vice versa.

However, the predicted output is still partially correct, as it includes the required fields'source', 'fraud_type', and 'alerted_transactions'. The 'date' and 'amount' fields are also present and match the reference output. The 'from' and 'to' objects contain the correct 'name' fields. The 'fraud_type' field has the same meaning as the reference output, even though the wording is not exact.

Therefore, the overall score is 0.8, indicating 80% correctness."

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Missing required fields in some transactions, inconsistent bank account numbers."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning:

The predicted output partially matches the reference output. Here are the areas of improvement:

1.  **Source and Fraud Type**: Both are correct and match the reference output.
2.  **Alerted Transactions**: The predicted output has two transactions, but the second transaction is missing the ""from"" object, which is a required field.
3.  **Date**: Both transactions have a date in a recognizable format, which matches the reference output.
4.  **Amount**: Both transactions have an amount with currency and numeric value, matching the reference output.
5.  **From and To Objects**: The ""from"" object in the first transaction is partially correct, but it's missing the ""account\_number"" field. The ""to"" object in both transactions is partially correct, but the account numbers do not match the reference output.
6.  **Channel**: This field is missing in both transactions, but it's not a required field.

Given these issues, the score is 0.5, indicating partial correctness. The reason for the low score is the presence of missing required fields and inconsistencies in the bank account numbers.","### Evaluation Output
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is mostly correct but lacks the 'account_number' field in the 'from' object for one of the transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

Explanation:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - The predicted output has the correct'source' and 'fraud_type' fields.
   - The 'alerted_transactions' field is present as an array, which is correct.

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - Both transactions have a 'date' field in a recognizable date format.
   - The 'amount' field includes both currency and numeric value for both transactions.
   - The 'from' and 'to' objects are present in both transactions.
   - The 'from' object in the second transaction is missing the 'account_number' field, which is present in the reference output.

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - The predicted output's field presence and structure generally align with the reference output.
   - The 'fraud_type' field has the same meaning as in the reference output.
   - The bank names can be matched based on the provided information.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

The score of 0.6 reflects that one out of two transactions has the 'account_number' field missing in the 'from' object, which is a significant error."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".

For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

### Reasoning

- The predicted output has all the required fields at the top level, including ""source"" and ""fraud_type"", which match the reference output.
- The ""police_reference"" field is also present in the predicted output, which is a conditionally required field.
- The ""police_team"" field is optional but present in the reference output, so it's included in the predicted output as well.
- For the ""alerted_transactions"" array, the predicted output contains a single transaction, which matches the reference output.
- Each transaction has the required fields: ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"". However, since there is no ""to"" field in the reference output, it's not considered incorrect, but it's worth noting.
- The ""from"" object in the predicted output contains the required fields: ""bank"" and ""account_number"", which match the reference output.
- The ""fraud_type"" in the predicted output matches the meaning of the reference output, so it's considered correct.
- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

Given that all the required fields are present and match the reference output, and the predicted output is valid JSON, the evaluation score is 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'police_team' field and incorrect order of 'from' object properties in alerted_transactions"",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - ""source"" is present and correct.
   - ""fraud_type"" is present and correct in meaning, but not exact wording.
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - ""police_reference"" is present and correct.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - ""police_team"" is missing, which is a required field in the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - ""date"" is present and in a recognizable date format.
   - ""amount"" is present and includes both currency and numeric value.
   - ""from"" object is present but the order of its properties is incorrect in the predicted output. In the reference output, ""bank"" comes before ""account_number"", but in the predicted output, it's the other way around.
   - ""to"" object is present but empty, which is correct according to the reference output.
   - ""channel"" is missing, which is an optional field in the reference output.

The score of 0.75 is based on the fact that 4 out of 6 fields in the global and per-transaction conditionally required fields are correct, and there are no issues with the global required fields."

  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

### Rationale:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - The predicted output contains the required fields at the top level: ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". However, it does not explicitly state the fraud type as ""AP - Investment"" but instead uses the exact wording, which is acceptable according to the guidelines. The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array.

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - The predicted output includes all the required fields for each transaction:
     - ""date"": The date is in a recognizable format (""2025-01-18"").
     - ""amount"": The amount includes currency (""HKD"") and numeric value (""100,000.00"").
     - ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields:
       - ""from"": The ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"" fields are present.
       - ""to"": The ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"" fields are present.
   - The ""channel"" field is not present, but it is conditionally required, so this is not a point of deduction.

3. Evaluation Criteria:
   - The predicted output aligns with the reference output in terms of field presence and structure.
   - Values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
   - The ""fraud_type"" is evaluated by meaning, and the predicted output uses the exact wording, which is acceptable.
   - Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations, and the predicted output uses the exact bank names.

Since the predicted output meets all the requirements and aligns with the reference output, the evaluation result is satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

### Reasoning

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source**: Present and matches the reference output.
   - **fraud_type**: Present and matches the reference output in terms of meaning (AP - Investment).
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array, with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date**: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - **amount**: Present and includes both currency and numeric value.
   - **from**: Present and includes name, account number, and bank.
   - **to**: Present and includes name, account number, and bank.
   - **channel**: Not present, which is acceptable since it's an optional field.

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Given the perfect alignment of the predicted output with the reference output, the evaluation score is 1.0."

### Explanation:

- The predicted output meets the guidelines for global required fields.
- The predicted output meets the guidelines for per-transaction conditionally required fields, except for the 'from' and 'to' account numbers which were swapped.
- The 'fraud_type' field is semantically correct, but not an exact match.
- The 'channel' field is present but not required, so it's a minor plus.
- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

The score of 0.8 reflects the overall correctness, considering the swapped account numbers as the main issue.","### Evaluation Output

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""Inconsistent transaction data. Missing channel information and incorrect account numbers in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale

The predicted output does not meet the guidelines for the Internal Referral case. 

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - The `source` field is correct.
   - The `fraud_type` field should be ""External"" instead of ""External Fraud"".
   - The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - The `date` field is present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - The `amount` field includes both currency and numeric value, but the formatting differs from the reference output.
   - The `from` and `to` objects are present, but the `account_number` fields do not match the reference output.
   - The `channel` field is missing.

Given the discrepancies, the score is 0.6, indicating partial correctness. The reason for the unsatisfactory output is provided as an explanation."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

   - The 'amount' field is present but has incorrect formatting (missing currency symbol and incorrect decimal places).
   - The 'from' field is present and correct in all transactions.
   - The 'to' field is missing in all transactions.

### Correctness Breakdown:

- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.
- The'source', 'fraud_type', 'police_reference', and 'police_team' fields are correct.
- The 'alerted_transactions' field is an array, but the transactions inside are missing the 'to' field and have incorrect 'amount' formatting.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

- The ""contact_person"" field is correctly included with the value ""PC ■■■■■"".
- However, the ""police_team"" field is missing, which is a conditionally required field according to the guidelines. This is the primary reason for the unsatisfactory evaluation.

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - The predicted output contains the required fields at the top level: ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". ""Source"" is correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"", and ""fraud_type"" is correctly identified as a phishing scam.
   - The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and contains an array of transactions.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction in the ""alerted_transactions"" array contains the required fields: ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"".
   - The ""date"" field in each transaction follows a recognizable date format.
   - The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value, and minor formatting differences are acceptable.
   - The ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields: ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"". The bank names are correctly identified with their respective aliases/abbreviations.
   - The ""channel"" field is not present, but it is conditionally required, so this is not a deduction.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The ""fraud_type"" is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
   - Bank names are matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
   - Partial correctness is acceptable, and the predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Given the above evaluation, the predicted output is satisfactory with a score of 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.4,
  ""reason"": ""Some fields are missing or incorrectly structured. Specifically, the 'date' field is missing for all transactions, and the 'from' and 'to' fields are not empty. The 'fraud_type' field is also not exactly as in the reference, but it is semantically correct."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning

- The predicted output has the required'source' field, which is correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
- The 'fraud_type' field is present but does not exactly match the reference output. However, it is semantically correct, as it indicates ""External Fraud"". This is acceptable.
- The 'alerted_transactions' field is present and is an array, which meets the requirements.
- For each transaction:
  - The 'amount' field is present and includes both currency and numeric value, so it is correct.
  - The 'from' field is not empty, which is incorrect because it should be empty according to the reference output.
  - The 'to' field is not empty, which is incorrect because it should be empty according to the reference output.
  - The 'date' field is missing for all transactions, which is incorrect because it should be present according to the reference output.

### Calculation

The score is calculated based on the number of correct fields. The maximum score is 1.0, and the minimum score is 0.0.

- Correct fields:
  -'source': 1.0
  - 'fraud_type': 0.5 (semantically correct, but not exactly as in the reference)
  - 'alerted_transactions' field is present and is an array: 1.0
  - 'amount' field is present and correctly formatted: 1.0
  - Total correct fields: 4.5
- Total possible fields: 7 (source, fraud_type, alerted_transactions, date, amount, from, to, channel)
- Score: 4.5 / 7 = 0.64 (rounded to 0.4)

However, given the format of the output requires the score to be a float between 0.0 and 1.0, we will use 0.4 as the final score.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Multiple issues with the predicted output. The predicted output has extra fields (date, from, to) and transactions that are not present in the correct output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 3,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

1. The predicted output includes all the required global fields at the top level: `source` and `fraud_type`. However, the `alerted_transactions` field is not correctly formatted, as it includes unnecessary fields (`date`, `from`, and `to`) and extra transactions.

2. The `alerted_transactions` field is an array, but it contains extra fields (`date`, `from`, and `to`) and transactions that are not present in the correct output. This is a significant deviation from the correct output.

3. The `fraud_type` field in the predicted output is ""External Fraud"", which is equivalent to the correct output's implied fraud type, but the correct output does not explicitly mention the fraud type.

4. The score is 0.5, indicating partial correctness. However, the predicted output has significant deviations from the correct output, making it unsatisfactory.

5. The reason for the unsatisfactory score is the presence of extra fields and transactions in the predicted output, which deviates from the correct output."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": null,
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source**: Correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - **fraud_type**: Correctly set to ""Other - Computer Crime"" (meaning alignment).
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date**: Correctly formatted as ""2024-08-07"".
   - **amount**: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 4,000.00"".
   - **from**: Correctly includes all fields: account_number, name, and bank.
     - **from.bank**: Correctly set to ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"".
   - **to**: Correctly includes all fields: account_number, name, and bank.
     - **to.bank**: Correctly set to ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."".

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - Field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically.
   - Bank names matched correctly.
   - Partial correctness is not applicable here since all fields are correct.

The predicted output matches the reference output perfectly, so the score is 1.0.","### Evaluation Output
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' object in the predicted output has the name field before account_number, whereas in the correct output, account_number comes first. Also, the 'to' object in the predicted output has the name field before account_number, whereas in the correct output, account_number comes first."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Explanation

The predicted output is mostly correct, but it contains two issues:

1.  In the ""from"" object, the name field is before the account_number field. In the correct output, the account_number field comes first. This is a minor formatting difference, but it affects the overall structure of the object.
2.  In the ""to"" object, the name field is before the account_number field. In the correct output, the account_number field comes first. This is another minor formatting difference that affects the structure of the object.

Given these issues, the score is 0.75, indicating a partially correct output. The reason for the deduction is provided in the ""reason"" field. The ""number_of_transactions_total"" field indicates that there is only one transaction in the output, and the ""number_of_transactions_correct"" field indicates that one transaction is correct."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,

  ""reason"": ""Transaction 'from' and 'to' account numbers are swapped in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source` is correct and equals ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type` is correct and expresses the same meaning as the reference (""External Fraud"").
   - `alerted_transactions` is present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date` is present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - `amount` is present and includes both currency and numeric value.
   - `from` and `to` objects are present, but their contents are incorrect. The `from` and `to` account numbers are swapped in the predicted output.

   Corrected fields would be:
   - `from`: {""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"", ""account_number"": ""555-555555-101""}
   - `to`: {""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"", ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101""}

   Since the predicted output contains only one transaction, the score for this transaction is 0.0.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'channel' field in one of the transactions, and incorrect 'from' and 'to' account numbers in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source**: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - **fraud_type**: The predicted output says ""External Fraud"", which is semantically incorrect for an Internal Referral case. However, since it's the only possible type for an Internal Referral, it's considered partially correct (0.5 points).
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array with one transaction, which is acceptable.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date**: Correctly formatted as ""2025-01-04"".
   - **amount**: Correctly includes currency and numeric value, but with minor formatting differences (spaces around the currency symbol).
   - **from**: Missing ""bank"" field, but ""account_number"" is present. Incorrect account number (should be ""555-555555-101"").
   - **to**: Missing ""bank"" field, but ""account_number"" is present. Incorrect account number (should be ""111-111111-101"").
   - **channel**: Missing, which is a partial deduction (0.3 points).

3. **Additional Observations:**
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.
   - Partial correctness is reflected in the score.

Overall, the predicted output is 80% correct, with deductions for the missing ""channel"" field and incorrect account numbers."

  ""reason"": ""Mismatch in account number of 'from' and 'to' transactions. 'from' has 444-4444444-102, but 'to' has 111-111111-102."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

The predicted output is partially correct but has a critical mismatch in the account numbers of the 'from' and 'to' transactions. This discrepancy affects the overall accuracy of the output. 

- The source field is correct.
- The fraud_type is partially correct but should be more specific, as it currently indicates 'External Fraud' instead of the more accurate 'Internal Referral'.
- The alerted_transactions array is present and has the correct structure.
- The date field is correct in format and value.
- The amount field is correct in format and value.
- The 'from' object is partially correct, as it contains the 'name' field but is missing the 'account_number' field present in the reference output.
- The 'to' object is partially correct, as it contains the 'name' field but has an incorrect 'account_number' field.
- The channel field is present and correct.

Given the significant mismatch in the account numbers, the score is set to 0.5, indicating partial correctness.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'from.bank' field in the predicted output, 'from.name' does not match, and 'from.account_number' is partially correct."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Reasoning:

- The `source` field is present and correct.
- The `fraud_type` field is present but does not exactly match the reference output. However, ""External Fraud"" conveys the same meaning as ""External Fraud"", so this is considered partially correct.
- The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array and contains one transaction.
- For the single transaction, the `date` field is present and in a recognizable date format.
- The `amount` field is present and includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences.
- The `from` object is present but lacks the `bank` field, which is a conditional requirement. However, it contains `name` and `account_number` fields.
- The `from.name` field does not match the reference output, resulting in a deduction.
- The `from.account_number` field is partially correct.
- The `to` object is present and contains `name` and `account_number` fields, which are correct.
- The `channel` field is present and correct.

The predicted output scores 0.6 out of 1.0 because it is partially correct, with some fields missing or not matching the reference output."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - The predicted output contains ""source"" with value ""Police Letter"", which is correct.
   - The ""fraud_type"" is ""Investment Scam"", which aligns with the reference output's meaning, even though the wording is exact.
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array with one transaction, which is correct.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The predicted output includes ""police_reference"" with the value ""POLICEREF1"", matching the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - ""police_team"" is present with the value ""District Investigation Team 4"", which matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction in the predicted output contains ""date"" in the format ""2024-07-26"", which is a recognizable date format.
   - ""amount"" includes both currency (HK$) and numeric value (10000), matching the reference output's format.
   - ""from"" and ""to"" objects are present with the required fields:
     - ""from"" contains ""account_number"" (66666666601) and ""bank"" (CCB), matching the reference output.
     - ""to"" contains ""account_number"" (111-111111-101) and ""name"" (CHAN TAI MAN), matching the reference output.

Since the predicted output matches the reference output in all required and conditionally required fields, and all per-transaction fields are present and correctly structured, the evaluation score is 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,

### Explanation:

- The ""source"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
- The ""fraud_type"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
- The ""police_reference"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
- The ""police_team"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" array is present in the predicted output, but it contains only one transaction, which is correct.
- For the single transaction in the predicted output:
  - The ""date"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
  - The ""amount"" field is present in the predicted output but has a formatting discrepancy (missing currency symbol).
  - The ""from"" object is partially correct:
    - The ""bank"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
    - The ""account_number"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
  - The ""to"" object is partially correct:
    - The ""name"" field is correct and present in the predicted output.
    - The ""account_number"" field is missing in the predicted output.
- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

The score of 0.6 reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output."

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""HSBC Referral"" as the source.
   - **fraud_type:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""AP- Impersonation (Police/Bank)"" being the correct fraud type.
   - **alerted_transactions:** The predicted output contains an array of transactions, which is correct.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""2025-01-24"" as the date.
   - **amount:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""HKD 10,900.00"" as the amount.
   - **from:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""YEUNG KAI"" as the name, ""666-66666-601"" as the account number, and ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" as the bank.
   - **to:** The predicted output matches the correct output, with ""111-111111-101"" as the account number and ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" as the bank.

All fields and values match between the predicted and correct outputs. The predicted output is well-structured and valid JSON.","### Evaluation

The predicted output is mostly correct, but there are some minor discrepancies that need to be addressed.

#### Global Required Fields
- **source**: Correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"".
- **fraud_type**: Correctly expressed as ""AP- Impersonation (Police/Bank)"".
- **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array, with one transaction.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields
- **date**: Correctly formatted as ""2025-01-24"".
- **amount**: Correctly includes currency and numeric value as ""HKD 10,900.00"".
- **from**: Correctly includes ""name"", ""account_number"", and ""bank"".
- **to**: Correctly includes ""account_number"" and ""bank"".

However, there are no issues with the predicted output, so there's no reason to deduct points.

### Rationale:

The predicted output is identical to the correct output. All required fields are present and match exactly. The `fraud_type` field is semantically equivalent, and the `alerted_transactions` array is present with the correct structure.

The `date` and `amount` fields are correctly formatted and match the reference output. The `from` and `to` objects are also correctly structured, with all required fields present and matching the reference output. The `bank` fields use equivalent names for the same institution.

There are no inconsistencies or areas for deduction, resulting in a perfect score of 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

Explanation:
- The predicted output has all the required fields at the top level, including'source', 'fraud_type', and 'alerted_transactions'. The'source' field matches the reference output, and the 'fraud_type' field conveys the same meaning.
- The 'alerted_transactions' array is present and contains a single transaction.
- For the transaction, the 'date' and 'amount' fields match the reference output in terms of content, but not in the order of fields in the 'from' and 'to' objects. 'account_number' should be before 'name' for consistency.
- Although the bank names are correctly identified, the order of fields within the 'from' and 'to' objects is incorrect. This is a significant deviation and accounts for the low score.
- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON."

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields**: The predicted output matches the reference output in terms of the source and fraud_type. The alerted_transactions array is present.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The date field is correctly formatted and matches the reference output.
   - The amount field includes both currency and numeric value and matches the reference output.
   - The 'from' object is correctly structured and contains the required fields (name and account_number).
   - However, the 'to' object is missing in one of the transactions in the predicted output. This is a deviation from the reference output, which includes a minimal 'to' object with no fields in both transactions.
   - The 'channel' field is present and matches the reference output.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output, except for the missing 'to' object in one transaction.
   - The values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

The score reflects the deviation in the 'to' object and the corresponding reduction in correctness.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

Explanation:
- The predicted output is valid JSON and has the required fields at the top level.
- The ""source"" field is correct.
- The ""fraud_type"" field is partially correct, but it should be matched semantically. In this case, it's correct.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and contains two transactions.
- Each transaction has a ""date"" field in a recognizable format.
- The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value.
- The ""from"" object contains the required ""name"" field but lacks the ""account_number"" field.
- The ""to"" object is missing required fields, specifically ""account_number"" or ""bank"".
- The ""channel"" field is incorrect for both transactions; it should be ""Others"" according to the reference output.
- The score reflects partial correctness, with deductions for missing fields and incorrect channel information."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:

  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:

- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.

### Reasoning:

The predicted output matches the reference output exactly, including all required and optional fields. The structure and values align perfectly, and there are no discrepancies in formatting or wording. The ""alerted_transactions"" array is empty as expected.

The score is 1.0, indicating a perfect match. The number of transactions is 0 since there are no transactions in the ""alerted_transactions"" array.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""reason"": ""Predicted fraud_type is incorrect, and police_team is missing."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

The predicted output is not entirely satisfactory due to the following reasons:

1.  **fraud_type**: The predicted output contains ""Not specified in the provided text"", which does not align with the correct output's ""Financial Crime Compliance"". Although the exact wording is not required, the meaning should be the same. In this case, the predicted output does not convey the correct meaning of fraud_type.

2.  **police_team**: This field is present in the correct output but is missing in the predicted output. Since it is a conditionally required field, its absence results in a deduction.

The score of 0.6 reflects the partial correctness of the output, as it includes some of the required fields correctly (source, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and alerted_transactions) and does not contain any incorrect information. However, the incorrect fraud_type and the missing police_team result in a deduction."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Rationale:

The predicted output is identical to the correct output, which meets all the guidelines specified. The predicted output includes all required fields at the top level and for each transaction. The values match semantically, and the structure is correct. The predicted output does not include any fields that are not present in the reference output, which is also a requirement. Therefore, the score is 1.0, indicating that the predicted output is satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,

  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is mostly correct, but there are some discrepancies in the 'to' object of the transaction."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

Explanation:

1. Global Required Fields:
   - ""source"" is correct.
   - ""fraud_type"" is correct in meaning, but the wording is slightly different. Acceptable.
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array.

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""police_reference"" is correct.

3. Global Optional Fields:
   - ""police_team"" is correct.

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
   - ""date"" is correct in format.
   - ""amount"" is correct in format but missing the currency. This is a significant discrepancy.
   - ""from"" is mostly correct, but it's missing the ""bank"" field is correct.
   - ""to"" is partially incorrect because the ""name"" and ""account_number"" are swapped.

Since the predicted output is mostly correct but has some significant discrepancies, the score is set to 0.8. The reason for the deduction is provided, and the number of transactions that are correct is 0 out of the total 1 transaction."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP LAM ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".

- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields

Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:

  ""reason"": ""Missing 'channel' field in one of the transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

- **Global Required Fields**: The predicted output contains all required fields at the top level.
  - ""source"" is correct.
  - ""fraud_type"" is correct, even though it's an exact match.
  - ""alerted_transactions"" is present and correctly formatted as an array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: The predicted output includes the ""police_reference"" field, which is present in the reference output.

- **Global Optional Fields**: The ""police_team"" field is present in the predicted output, matching the reference.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: The predicted output includes the required fields for each transaction.
  - ""date"" is correctly formatted.
  - ""amount"" is correct, including currency and numeric value.
  - ""from"" contains ""name"" and ""account_number"", which are required fields.

However, there is a discrepancy in the predicted output:
- The ""channel"" field is missing in the predicted output, which is present in the reference output for the same transaction.

Given the presence of all required fields and the correct structure, the score is 0.8, reflecting partial correctness.","### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'channel' field in the first transaction and incorrect bank name in 'from' object. Also, minor formatting differences in 'amount'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reasoning:

- The ""source"" field is correct, which is a required field.
- The ""fraud_type"" is correct, which is a required field.
- The ""police_reference"" field is correct, which is a conditionally required field.
- The ""police_team"" field is incorrect; it should be ""District Investigation Team 3"" instead of ""DIT 3"", which is an optional field.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array, which is a required field.
- In the first transaction, the ""date"" field is correct.
- The ""amount"" field is partially correct; it should be ""HK$50000"" instead of ""HK$50,000"", which is a minor formatting difference.
- The ""from"" object is partially correct; it should have ""bank"" as ""Bank of China"" or its alias instead of ""NA CASH"", which is an incorrect bank name.
- The ""to"" object is missing, which is a required field for each transaction.
- The ""channel"" field is missing, which is an optional field for each transaction.

### Score Breakdown:
- Required fields: 0.8 (all required fields are present except for ""to"" object)
- Conditionally required fields: 1.0 (all conditionally required fields are present)
- Optional fields: 0.5 (only ""police_team"" is incorrect, and ""channel"" is missing)
- Per-transaction fields: 0.4 (minor formatting difference in ""amount"", incorrect bank name in ""from"" object, and missing ""to"" and ""channel"" fields)"

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning

The predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects. 

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - ""source"" is correctly set to ""ADCC"".
  - ""fraud_type"" is correctly identified as ""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"" (even though the wording is not an exact match, it conveys the same meaning).
  - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array with one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - ""police_reference"" is correctly included and matches the correct output.
  - ""police_team"" is correctly included and matches the correct output.

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - ""police_team"" is included, which is optional.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - Each transaction has ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"" fields.
  - ""date"" follows a recognizable date format.
  - ""amount"" includes both currency and numeric value.
  - ""from"" and ""to"" objects have the required fields (name, account_number, bank).

- **Evaluation Criteria:**
  - All fields are present and structured correctly.
  - Values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
  - Bank names are correctly matched (HSBC is recognized as a valid bank name, and HSB is matched with HSBC).

The predicted output is a perfect match with the correct output, resulting in a score of 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'bank' field in 'from' and 'to' objects, but the 'bank' field in the 'from' object is partially correct as 'HSB' is an abbreviation for 'HSBC'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

- The predicted output matches the reference output in terms of the global required fields (""source"", ""fraud_type"", and ""alerted_transactions"").
- The ""police_reference"" field is also present in the predicted output, satisfying the conditionally required field.
- The ""police_team"" field is present, which is optional.
- For the single transaction, the date, amount, ""from"", and ""to"" fields are present, which is a good start.
- However, the ""from"" and ""to"" objects are missing the ""bank"" field, which is conditionally required if present in the reference output.
- Despite the missing ""bank"" field, the predicted output for the ""bank"" in the ""from"" object is partially correct as ""HSB"" is an abbreviation for ""HSBC"".

Given these points, the score is 0.8, indicating that 80% of the output is correct."

### Rationale

1.  **Global Required Fields:**
    *   The predicted output contains the required fields at the top level: `source` and `fraud_type`. The `source` field is correctly set to ""HSBC Referral,"" and the `fraud_type` is also correctly identified as ""Impersonation.""
    *   The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array, which is correct.

2.  **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
    *   For the single transaction in the `alerted_transactions` array:
        *   The `date` field is present and follows a recognizable date format (""2024-12-03"").
        *   The `amount` field includes both currency (""HKD"") and numeric value (""50,001.00""), which is correct.
        *   The `from` object contains the required fields:
            *   `name` is present and correctly set to ""CHAN TAI MAN.""
            *   `account_number` is present and correctly set to ""333-333333-101.""
            *   `bank` is present and correctly set to ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,"" which is a known alias for HSBC.
        *   The `to` object also contains the required fields:
            *   `name` is present and correctly set to ""CHAN TAI MAN.""
            *   `account_number` is present and correctly set to ""111-111111-101.""
            *   `bank` is present and correctly set to ""HANG SENG BANK LTD.,"" which is a known alias for Hang Seng Bank.

3.  **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   The predicted output aligns with the reference output in terms of field presence and structure.
    *   Values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
    *   The `fraud_type` is correctly identified as ""Impersonation,"" which aligns with the reference output.
    *   Bank names are correctly matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
    *   The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

Given the above evaluation, the predicted output is satisfactory, and the score is 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source` is present and correct.
   - `fraud_type` is present and conveys the same meaning as the reference output, although it is not an exact match. The predicted output says ""External Fraud"", while the correct output says the same. This is acceptable.
   - `alerted_transactions` is present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The predicted output includes the required fields for each transaction, matching the reference output.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - All field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, with no significant formatting or wording differences.
   - Bank names are not present in the predicted output, but this is not a requirement for this case.
   - The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

Given the perfect alignment of the predicted output with the reference output, the evaluation is satisfactory with a score of 1.0.","### Evaluation Output

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Missing account_number in 'from' object, missing account_number in 'to' object, missing channel in 'alerted_transactions[0]'"",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Explanation

- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.
- The source field is correct.
- The fraud_type is incorrect as it should be ""Internal Fraud"" (as it's an internal referral), but the meaning is not exactly matched. However, considering the context of the question, we will evaluate it as incorrect. 
- The alerted_transactions array is present and contains one element.
- In the first transaction, the date field is correct.
- The amount field is correct.
- In the 'from' object, the name field is correct, but the account_number field is missing. This is a significant deduction.
- In the 'to' object, the name field is correct, but the account_number field is incorrect (should be ""111-111111-101"" instead of ""347■■■■■""). This is another significant deduction.
- The channel field is missing in the 'alerted_transactions[0]', which is another significant deduction.

Considering these points, the score is 0.5."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Explanation

The predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source` is ""ADCC"" in both outputs.
   - `fraud_type` is ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" in both outputs.
   - `alerted_transactions` is an array in both outputs with the same number of transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference` exists in the predicted output with a similar format to the reference output.
   - `police_team` exists in the predicted output with the same value as in the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team` is present in the predicted output, which is also present in the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - All transactions in the predicted output contain `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to` fields.
   - `from` and `to` objects contain the required fields (`name`, `account_number`, and `bank`) with matching values in both outputs.

Given the complete match between the predicted and correct outputs, the score is 1.0, indicating that the predicted output is satisfactory."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

  - ""source"" is present and equal to ""ADCC"" (Score: 1.0)
  - ""fraud_type"" is present and semantically correct (Score: 1.0)
  - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array (Score: 1.0)

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - ""police_reference"" is present, but the format is slightly different (Score: 0.8)

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - ""police_team"" is present (Score: 1.0)

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - ""date"" is present and in a recognizable date format (Score: 1.0)
  - ""amount"" is present with currency and numeric value (Score: 1.0)
  - ""from"" is present with ""name"" and ""account_number"" (Score: 1.0)
  - ""to"" is present with ""name"" and ""account_number"", but missing ""bank"" (Score: 0.8)

The overall score is 0.8, indicating that the predicted output is partially correct. The reason for the deduction is the missing ""bank"" information in the ""to"" object of the alerted transaction."

The ""source"" field is correctly set to ""Internal Referral"", the ""fraud_type"" is correctly identified as ""External Fraud"", and the ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and contains an array of transactions.

Each transaction in the predicted output matches the correct output, with the same fields present and values matching semantically. The date is in a recognizable format, the amount includes both currency and numeric value, and the ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields.

The predicted output is also valid, structured JSON.","### Evaluation Output

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Partial correctness in transaction data. 'bank' field in the 'to' object is not present in the correct output, but 'account_number' is correct. 'from' object is missing 'account_number' in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Explanation

- The source field is present and correct.
- The fraud_type field is present but not entirely correct. The predicted output says ""External Fraud"", but the correct output implies a different type of fraud. However, since the exact wording is not required, this could be considered a minor issue.
- The alerted_transactions array is present and contains one transaction.
- The date field is present and correctly formatted.
- The amount field is present and correctly formatted.
- The from object is present but is missing the account_number field in the predicted output. However, the name field is correct.
- The to object is present but contains an extra field (bank) in the predicted output. However, the account_number field is correct.
- Since the predicted output has some correct information but also some incorrect, a score of 0.5 is given, indicating partial correctness."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.

1. The predicted output meets the ""source"" and ""alerted_transactions"" requirements.
2. The ""fraud_type"" field does not match the reference output, which is a major deduction.
3. In the first transaction, the ""from"" object is missing the ""account_number"" field, which is a minor deduction.
4. In the second transaction, the ""from"" object is missing the ""account_number"" field, which is a minor deduction.
5. The ""to"" object in the first transaction is missing the ""account_number"" field, which is a minor deduction.
6. The ""amount"" and ""date"" fields are correctly structured and match the reference output for the correct transaction.
7. The score is calculated based on the number of correct and incorrect fields. Since there are 2 transactions in total and 4 fields are incorrect, the score is 0.4 (4/10).","### Evaluation Output:

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

### Rationale:

- The predicted output has the required fields at the top level: ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". However, ""alerted_transactions"" is a list with two transactions, which is correct.
- For each transaction, the predicted output includes the required fields: ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"". However, some fields are missing or inconsistent:
  - The ""to"" object in the second transaction is missing the ""account_number"" field.
  - The ""from"" object in both transactions is missing the ""account_number"" field.
- The field presence and structure are mostly aligned with the reference output, but there are some discrepancies.
- Values match semantically, but some fields have different wording or formatting.
- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

The score of 0.5 reflects the partial correctness of the predicted output, with two out of four transactions having some issues."

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Reasoning:

The predicted output matches the reference output in all aspects. All required fields are present, including the `source`, `fraud_type`, and `alerted_transactions`. The conditionally required fields (`police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person`) are also present, and the optional field (`police_team`) is included as well. There are no transactions to evaluate, so the number of correct transactions is 0. The score is 1.0, indicating a perfect match.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'police_team' field and 'alerted_transactions' is an empty array, but not explicitly mentioned in the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

1. Global Required Fields:
- ""source"": Correct, equals ""Search Warrant"".
- ""fraud_type"": Correct, although the wording is slightly different, it conveys the same meaning as the reference output.
- ""alerted_transactions"": Present as an array, but it's empty and not explicitly mentioned in the reference output. However, it should not be omitted.

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
- ""police_reference"": Correct, matches the reference output.
- ""writ_no"": Correct, matches the reference output.
- ""contact_person"": Correct, matches the reference output.

3. Global Optional Fields:
- ""police_team"": Missing in the predicted output.

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:
- No transactions are present in the predicted output, so there's no evaluation for these fields.

The score of 0.8 reflects the fact that the predicted output is mostly correct, but lacks the ""police_team"" field and doesn't explicitly mention the empty ""alerted_transactions"" array."

- The ""fraud_type"" field is present and conveys the same meaning as the reference output (Impersonation).
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array.

However, the predicted output is not entirely correct because it is missing the ""name"" field in the ""to"" object. This field is conditionally required and present in the reference output. Since the ""account_number"" field is present, it suggests that the ""to"" object is correctly structured, but the absence of ""name"" is a critical difference.

Given the partial correctness, the score is set to 0.6. The reason for the deduction is provided for clarity.","### Evaluation Output

Explanation:
- The predicted output has all the required fields at the top level, which is correct.

- The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array in the predicted output.
- For each transaction, the predicted output includes the required fields:
  - `date` is in a recognizable date format.
  - `amount` includes both currency and numeric value.
  - `from` and `to` objects are present with the required fields.
  - `channel` is an optional field that is present in the predicted output.
- However, there are two discrepancies:
  - The predicted output has `from` details, but the correct output is missing them.
  - The predicted output does not have the extra field (`account_number`) in the `to` object, but the correct output has it.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output matches the reference output in terms of structure and field presence.
- The ""source"" field is correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
- The ""fraud_type"" field is correctly set to ""Telephone Deception"", which matches the intended meaning.
- The ""police_reference"" field is present and matches the reference output.
- The ""police_team"" field is present and matches the reference output.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present and contains one transaction, which is correct.
- Each transaction in the ""alerted_transactions"" array has the required fields: ""date"", ""amount"", ""to"", and ""from"".
- The ""date"" field is in a recognizable date format.
- The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value, and minor formatting differences are acceptable.
- The ""to"" and ""from"" objects contain the required fields: ""account_number"" and ""name"" for ""to"", and ""account_number"" and ""bank"" for ""from"".
- The ""bank"" name is matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

The predicted output is satisfactory with a score of 1.0, as it matches the reference output perfectly.","### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.67,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'to.bank' and incorrect 'to.account_number' format. Missing 'amount.currency' in the predicted output."",

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source:** Passed (both ""Police Letter"")
   - **fraud_type:** Passed (both ""Telephone Deception"")
   - **alerted_transactions:** Passed (present as an array)

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **police_reference:** Passed (both ""Policeref1"")

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - **police_team:** Passed (both ""District Investigation Team 4"")

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date:** Passed (both ""2024-05-22"")
   - **amount:** Failed (missing ""amount.currency"" in the predicted output)
   - **from:** Passed (both present)
     - **from.account_number:** Passed (both ""222-222222-101"")
     - **from.bank:** Passed (both ""Hang Seng Bank"")
   - **to:** Failed (incorrect ""to.account_number"" format in the predicted output)
     - **to.account_number:** Failed (should be ""111-111111-101"" instead of ""CHAN TAI MAN"")
     - **to.name:** Passed (both ""CHAN TAI MAN"")
     - **to.bank:** Missing (predicted output has ""bank"" as ""111-111111-101"" which is an account number, not a bank name)

Considering the above points, the predicted output is partially correct. The score is calculated based on the number of correct fields (0 out of 8) and the total number of fields (8)."
