}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}

### Rationale:

- The predicted output has the required fields at the top level: source and fraud_type. However, the wording of fraud_type does not exactly match the reference, but it conveys the same meaning, so it is considered correct.
- alerted_transactions is present as an array.
- For the single transaction:
  - date is present and in a recognizable date format.
  - amount includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences.
  - from and to objects are present, but their account numbers are swapped, which is a significant inconsistency.
  - channel is present and matches the reference.

Given the partial correctness, the score is 0.75.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The predicted output is satisfactory because it meets all the required guidelines:

1. **Global Required Fields**: The predicted output contains the required fields at the top level: ""source"" is equal to ""Internal Referral"", ""fraud_type"" conveys the same meaning as the reference (""External Fraud""), and ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: Each transaction in the predicted output includes the required fields:
   - ""date"" is in a recognizable date format (""2025-01-04"").
   - ""amount"" includes both currency and numeric value (""HKD 45,500.00"").
   - ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields: ""name"" and ""account_number"".
   - ""channel"" is an optional field indicating the payment method (""FPS"").

3. **Evaluation Criteria**: The predicted output aligns with the reference output in terms of field presence and structure. The values match semantically, and the bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

Since the predicted output is identical to the reference output, the score is 1.0, indicating perfect correctness."

  ""reason"": ""Some fields are missing or incorrect in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,

}

### Explanation

The predicted output has several issues:

1. The ""fraud_type"" is incorrect, as it should be ""Internal Referral"" to match the source.
2. The ""alerted_transactions"" array has two transactions, but only the first one is present in the reference output.
3. The second transaction in the predicted output is missing the ""from"" field.
4. The ""from"" field in the first transaction has the ""name"" but is missing the ""account_number"".
5. The ""to"" field in the first transaction has the correct ""name"" and ""account_number"", but the account number format is different from the reference output.

### Score Breakdown

- Source: 0 (Incorrect)
- Fraud Type: 0 (Incorrect)
- Transactions: 0 (2/2 transactions are incorrect)

The overall score is 0.5, indicating that half of the required fields are correct.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Missing fields and inconsistent values in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reason:

- The predicted output has the correct source and fraud type, but it's missing the account number in the ""from"" object for the first transaction.
- The predicted output has the correct date and amount for both transactions, but the amount for the second transaction is missing the ""from"" object.
- The predicted output has the correct ""to"" object for both transactions, but the account number for the ""to"" object in the first transaction is missing.
- The predicted output has an extra transaction that is not present in the reference output.
- The predicted output has an extra field ""channel"" in the first transaction, which is not present in the reference output.

### Score Breakdown:

- The maximum possible score is 1.0.
- The minimum possible score is 0.0.
- The predicted output has some correct fields and values, but it also has significant errors, so the score is 0.5."

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Explanation:
The predicted output is identical to the correct output, suggesting that it is accurate and complete. The following criteria are met:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - ""source"" is ""Police Letter"".
   - ""fraud_type"" correctly expresses the same meaning as the reference fraud type (""Employment Fraud"").
   - ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - ""police_reference"" is present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - ""police_team"" is present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction has a ""date"" field following a recognizable date format.
   - Each transaction has an ""amount"" field with both currency and numeric value.
   - Each transaction's ""from"" and ""to"" fields contain the required information.
   - No channel field is required in this case.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.","### Evaluation Output:

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,

```

### Rationale:

- The predicted output matches the reference output in all required fields, including the source, fraud type, police reference, and alerted transactions. The police team is also correctly included, even though it's not strictly required.
- The structure of each transaction in the alerted transactions array is identical to the reference output, including date, amount, from, and to fields.
- The date format is recognizable and matches the reference output.
- The amount includes both currency and numeric value, and minor formatting differences are acceptable.
- The 'from' object contains the required fields, with the bank name being a known alias for the Bank of China (BOC).
- The predicted output is a valid, structured JSON.

Given the predicted output matches the reference output in all aspects, the evaluation output indicates that the predicted output is satisfactory with a score of 1.0."

### Rationale:

The predicted output meets all the requirements for the HSBC Referral case. The source field is correctly set to ""HSBC Referral"", the fraud_type is equivalent to the reference output (""AP - Investment""), and alerted_transactions is present as an array.

For the single transaction, all the required fields are present and correctly structured:
- date follows a recognizable date format (""2025-01-18"").
- amount includes both currency and numeric value (""HKD100,000.00"").
- from and to objects contain the required fields, with name, account_number, and bank present in both.
- The bank names are matched correctly, with ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" and ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" being equivalent to the reference output.

There are no inconsistencies or missing fields, so the score is 1.0, and the output is deemed satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

Reason: The predicted output matches the reference output exactly in terms of structure and content. The predicted output has all the required fields, and the values match semantically. The ""fraud_type"" is also correct, and the ""bank"" names are matched correctly using their known aliases or abbreviations. Therefore, the score is 1.0, indicating that the predicted output is fully satisfactory."

### Rationale:
- The predicted output meets all the required fields and their structure, with a score of 1.0 for those.
- The `fraud_type` field is correctly identified as ""Impersonation"", aligning with the meaning in the reference output.
- The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains one transaction, as expected.
- The transaction's date is correctly formatted as a recognizable date.
- The amount includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences (spacing, punctuation) being acceptable.
- The `from` and `to` objects are present and contain the required fields. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the order of account numbers between the two objects. This discrepancy results in a deduction of 0.1 from the total score.
- The `channel` field is not present, which is not a requirement, so no deduction is made for its absence.

  ""reason"": ""Inconsistent account numbers between 'from' and 'to' transactions."",

### Reasoning:

The predicted output contains all the required fields at the top level, including ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". The ""alerted_transactions"" array is also present.

For the per-transaction fields, the ""date"" field is correctly formatted. The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value.

However, the ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain inconsistent account numbers. In the reference output, the ""from"" account number is ""333-333333-101"", while in the predicted output, it is ""111-111111-101"". The ""to"" account number is also swapped in the predicted output.

The ""channel"" field is present, which is an optional field, so it does not affect the evaluation.

Given the inconsistencies, the score is 0.8, indicating partial correctness. The reason for the deduction is provided to highlight the specific area of improvement.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,

  ""reason"": ""Transaction order of 'from' and 'to' account numbers is incorrect in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Explanation:

The predicted output is mostly correct, but it has one critical error. The 'from' and 'to' account numbers are swapped in the predicted output. The 'from' account number should be '111-111111-101' and the 'to' account number should be '333-333333-101' based on the correct output. The rest of the information matches the correct output.

The score is 0.8 because the predicted output has 80% correctness. The'source' and 'fraud_type' fields are correct, and the 'date', 'amount', 'channel' fields are correct. The 'from' and 'to' objects are mostly correct, but the account numbers are swapped."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

The predicted output matches the reference output perfectly, including all required fields and their structures. The values are semantically correct, with matching bank names (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and Hang Seng Bank Ltd.) and account numbers. The dates, amounts, and names are also correctly formatted and matched.

The predicted output is a valid, structured JSON. Since all required fields are present and correctly formatted, with no discrepancies or missing information, the predicted output is considered satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output:

### Evaluation Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - The `source` field is present and set to ""HSBC Referral"", which matches the reference output.
   - The `fraud_type` field is present and set to ""Phishing Scam"", which matches the reference output in meaning.
   - The `alerted_transactions` field is present as an array with three elements, which matches the reference output.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - All three transactions have a `date` field with a recognizable date format.
   - All three transactions have an `amount` field with both currency and numeric value, and minor formatting differences are acceptable.
   - All three transactions have a `from` object with `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields, which match the reference output.
   - All three transactions have a `to` object with `name`, `account_number`, and `bank` fields, which match the reference output.

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - The values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
   - Partial correctness is acceptable, and the predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Therefore, the predicted output is considered **satisfactory** with a score of 1.0."

  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,

}

### Rationale:

- The predicted output is valid JSON.
- The source field is correct.
- The fraud_type field is semantically correct but not exactly matched, so it will be considered partially correct.
- The alerted_transactions field is present and contains an array of objects.

However, the predicted output contains errors in the following areas:
- The date field is missing for both transactions, which is a required field for each transaction.
- The from and to fields are present but are incomplete for both transactions. They should contain at least one of the required subfields (name, account_number, bank).
- The number of correct transactions is 0, since none of the transactions match the reference output.

Therefore, the overall score is 0.5, indicating partial correctness.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Some transactions are missing required fields and others have extra fields. Specifically, the 'from' field is missing in the second transaction and the 'to' field is missing in the first transaction. Additionally, the 'date' field is missing for both transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation

The predicted output has several issues that prevent it from matching the reference output:

1.  **Extra fields in transactions:** The predicted output includes 'name' fields in both 'from' and 'to' objects, which are not present in the reference output. These fields should be removed.
2.  **Missing fields in transactions:** The 'date' field is missing for both transactions in the predicted output, which is required in the reference output.
3.  **Missing fields in transactions:** The 'from' field is missing in the second transaction and the 'to' field is missing in the first transaction in the predicted output, which are required in the reference output.
4.  **fraud_type:** Although the 'fraud_type' field is present in the predicted output, it does not match the reference output. The predicted output indicates 'External Fraud', but the reference output indicates a different type of fraud.

The score is 0.5 because the predicted output partially matches the reference output. However, the output has several issues that prevent it from being considered satisfactory."

These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

- **Global Required Fields**:
  - **source**: The predicted output contains ""source"": ""HSBC Referral"", which matches the reference output.
  - **fraud_type**: The predicted output contains ""fraud_type"": ""Other - Computer Crime"", which is semantically equivalent to the reference output's ""Other - Computer Crime"".
  - **alerted_transactions**: The predicted output contains an array of transactions, which is correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - **date**: The predicted output contains ""date"": ""2024-08-07"", which matches the reference output and follows a recognizable date format.
  - **amount**: The predicted output contains ""amount"": ""HKD 4,000.00"", which matches the reference output and includes both currency and numeric value.
  - **from** and **to**: The predicted output contains objects for ""from"" and ""to"" with the required fields: ""account_number"", ""name"", and ""bank"", all of which match the reference output.
  - **channel**: The predicted output does not contain the ""channel"" field, which is optional.

Since the predicted output matches the reference output in all required fields and the optional ""channel"" field is not present, the predicted output is considered **satisfactory**.","### Evaluation Output:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' object in the predicted output has the 'name' field before 'account_number', which is not present in the correct output. However, the field presence and structure for 'to' object is correct."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Explanation:
The predicted output is mostly correct, but it has a minor inconsistency in the 'from' object where the 'name' field comes before 'account_number'. This is not present in the correct output. However, the 'to' object is correctly structured. The score is 0.75 because the overall structure and most fields are correct, but there is a small inconsistency."

These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""reason"": ""Incorrect 'from' and 'to' account numbers in the predicted output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,

### Reasoning:

- The predicted output meets the Global Required Fields criteria:
  - source is equal to ""Internal Referral"".
  - fraud_type expresses the same meaning as the reference fraud type (""External Fraud"").
  - alerted_transactions is present as an array with one transaction.

- The predicted output meets the Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields criteria for the given transaction:
  - date is in a recognizable date format.
  - amount includes both currency and numeric value.
  - from and to objects contain the required fields (name and account_number).
  - channel is an optional field indicating the payment method.

- However, there is a discrepancy in the 'from' and 'to' account numbers, which affects the overall accuracy of the predicted output. The predicted output has 'from' and 'to' account numbers swapped compared to the reference output. This error results in a score of 0.75 (3/4) because the predicted output is mostly correct but has a significant error in the transaction details.

- The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.","### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""Transaction order of 'from' and 'to' account numbers is incorrect."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Reasoning:

- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source` is correct and equals ""Internal Referral"".
  - `fraud_type` is incorrect and does not match the reference output. It should be ""External"" instead of ""External Fraud"".
  - `alerted_transactions` is present and is an array, which is correct.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date` is correct and follows a recognizable date format.
  - `amount` is correct and includes both currency and numeric value.
  - `from` and `to` objects are present, but their values are swapped. The reference output has the sender's account number as ""555-555555-101"" and the receiver's as ""111-111111-101"". The predicted output has it the other way around.
  - `channel` is correct and equals ""FPS"".

Given these discrepancies, the score is 0.75, indicating partial correctness. The reason for the deduction is the incorrect order of 'from' and 'to' account numbers."

- The 'to' object has an incorrect 'account_number' in the predicted output, which is another significant discrepancy.
- The 'date', 'amount', 'channel', and 'fraud_type' fields are correct in the predicted output.
- The'source' field is also correct in the predicted output.","### Evaluation Output:

### Explanation:

- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.
- The ""source"" field is correct.
- The ""fraud_type"" field does not match the reference, but it is close in meaning (External Fraud), so it is partially correct. However, it should be ""Internal Referral"" to match the reference output.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" array is present and contains one transaction.
- The transaction's ""date"" field is correct.
- The transaction's ""amount"" field is correct.
- The transaction's ""from"" object is missing the ""account_number"" field, so it is partially correct.
- The transaction's ""to"" object has an incorrect ""account_number"", so it is incorrect.
- The transaction's ""channel"" field is correct.

Given the above points, the score is 0.75 (7.5/10), indicating partial correctness."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,

### Rationale:
The predicted output matches the reference output in all aspects, including the presence and structure of fields, as well as the values. The fields ""source"", ""fraud_type"", ""police_reference"", and ""police_team"" are present and correct. The ""alerted_transactions"" array contains a single transaction with the required fields ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"", all of which are present and correctly structured. The ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields ""account_number"" and ""bank"" or ""name"", respectively, and the ""bank"" field matches the reference output with an acceptable alias. The ""channel"" field is not present, which is acceptable since it is an optional field. Therefore, the predicted output is considered satisfactory with a score of 1.0.","### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""Missing 'to' field in the transaction object and incorrect 'from' field structure (missing 'name' and incorrect order of 'bank' and 'account_number')."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```
### Explanation:

The predicted output partially matches the correct output. The predicted output correctly includes the required global fields and one transaction. However, it fails to include the 'to' field and incorrectly structures the 'from' field.

- The'source' field is correct.
- The 'fraud_type' field is correct in meaning but not exact wording.
- The 'police_reference' field is correct.
- The 'police_team' field is not present in the correct output, so it is not included in the predicted output.
- The 'alerted_transactions' field is present as an array with one transaction.
- The transaction's 'date' field is correct.
- The transaction's 'amount' field is correct.
- The transaction's 'from' field is incorrect due to missing 'name' and incorrect order of 'bank' and 'account_number'.
- The transaction's 'to' field is missing.

The score is 0.5 because the predicted output partially matches the correct output."

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source**: The predicted output matches the reference output, having ""HSBC Referral"" as the source.
   - **fraud_type**: The predicted output correctly identifies the fraud type as ""AP- Impersonation (Police/Bank)"", aligning with the reference output.
   - **alerted_transactions**: The predicted output contains an array of transactions, which is correct.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date**: The predicted output includes a date in the format ""2025-01-24"", which is recognizable and matches the reference output.
   - **amount**: The predicted output includes the amount in the format ""HKD 10,900.00"", which matches the reference output in terms of currency and numeric value.
   - **from** and **to**: Both objects contain the required fields with matching values. The bank names are correctly identified, and the account numbers are present.
   - **channel**: The predicted output does not contain the channel field, which is optional.

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - The values match semantically, even with minor formatting differences.
   - The fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
   - Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
   - The predicted output is valid and structured JSON.

Given the perfect match between the predicted and reference outputs, the evaluation output indicates that the predicted output is satisfactory with a score of 1.0."

### Explanation

The predicted output is partially correct. It includes the required fields at the top level and has a recognizable date format. However, it lacks the ""to"" object in one of the transactions. The ""fraud_type"" field is correctly identified as ""Impersonation"", and the bank names are correctly identified.

  ""reason"": ""Missing 'to' object in two transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 2
}
```

### Reasoning

The predicted output is mostly correct, but it lacks the ""to"" object in two transactions, which is a conditionally required field. However, the predicted output is still valid and structured as JSON. 

The ""fraud_type"" field is correct in terms of meaning, even though the wording is not an exact match. The ""source"" field is correct, and the ""alerted_transactions"" array is present.

The ""date"" and ""amount"" fields are correctly formatted, and the ""from"" object contains the required fields. The ""channel"" field is also present in each transaction.

Since two transactions are missing the ""to"" object, which is a conditionally required field, the score is 0.8 (80%)."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

- The police_team field is missing, which is a requirement since it exists in the reference output.
- The police_team value is incorrect; it should be ""N/A"" instead of ""Not specified"".
- The fraud_type is incorrect; it should be ""Financial Crime Compliance"" instead of ""Not specified"".
- Since alerted_transactions is an empty array, there are no transactions to evaluate, so number_of_transactions_total and number_of_transactions_correct are both 0."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case IP YUEN ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

### Explanation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - **source**: Present and correct.
   - **fraud_type**: Present and correct in meaning, but not exactly matching the reference output. However, ""Bounced Cheque"" is a valid interpretation of the reference output's fraud type.
   - **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - **police_reference**: Present and correct.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - **police_team**: Present, but contains extra information not present in the reference output. This is a deduction.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction in **alerted_transactions** is present with the required fields:
     - **date**: Correct format.
     - **amount**: Correct format and value.
     - **from**: Correct fields with values.
     - **to**: Correct fields with values.
     - **channel**: Not present, which is acceptable since it's optional.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The structure of the predicted output aligns with the reference output.
   - Values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

The score of 0.8 reflects the presence of the extra information in the **police_team** field, which is the only major deduction."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.

### Reasoning:
The predicted output is partially correct, but it lacks the 'channel' field in the 'alerted_transactions' array and incorrectly handles the 'from' field. This results in a score of 0.6, indicating partial correctness. The 'is_satisfactory' flag is set to false due to these discrepancies.","### Evaluation Output:

Explanation:

- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source` is present and correct.
  - `fraud_type` is present and correct.
  - `alerted_transactions` is present and correct (empty array is acceptable).

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**: 
  - `police_reference` is present and correct.

- **Global Optional Fields**: 
  - `police_team` is present but incorrect. The correct output contains ""District Investigation Team 3"" without ""Yuen Long District"".

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: 
  - The single transaction in `alerted_transactions` has `date` and `amount` fields present and correct.
  - `from` object is present and has `name` and `account_number` fields, which are present and correct.
  - However, `to` object is missing, which is a conditional requirement.
  - `channel` field is missing, which is an optional field but present in the correct output.

The predicted output is mostly correct, but it lacks the `channel` field and has an incorrect `police_team` value. Therefore, the score is 0.6, indicating partial correctness."

Please be informed of a case of **""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service""** reported on **2024-12-05** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 4 ■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

The predicted output is identical to the correct output. All required fields are present at the top level, and per-transaction fields match the reference output. The ""fraud_type"" field is semantically equivalent, and the ""bank"" field in the ""from"" and ""to"" objects match with known aliases or abbreviations.

}
```
Explanation:

- The predicted output is valid JSON and includes all required fields at the top level.
- The'source' field is correct.
- The 'fraud_type' field is correct in terms of meaning, but the wording does not exactly match. However, since the evaluation criteria allow for minor variations, this is acceptable.
- The 'alerted_transactions' field is present and contains an array of transactions.
- Each transaction in the 'alerted_transactions' array includes the required fields.
- The 'date' field in the first transaction follows a recognizable date format.
- The 'amount' field in the first transaction includes both currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences.
- The 'from' and 'to' objects in the first transaction contain the required fields.
- The 'bank' field in the 'from' and 'to' objects match the correct institution, with known aliases or abbreviations accepted.
- The 'channel' field is missing, which is not a required field.
- The 'name' field in the 'from' object is in the correct position.
- The 'account_number' field in the 'from' object is in the wrong position, which is the main reason for the deduction.

The score is 0.8 because the predicted output is mostly correct, but with a significant error in the 'from' object of the first transaction."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}

### Reason:
The predicted output is a perfect match with the correct output. All required fields are present and structured correctly. The values match semantically, and the bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations. The only difference in the output is the absence of any reason for deduction, which is not required in this case.","### Evaluation Output

  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is missing the 'channel' field in the 'to' transaction object."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Rationale

The predicted output is mostly correct, but it lacks the ""channel"" field in the ""to"" transaction object. The ""fraud_type"" field is also incorrect, but since the predicted output says ""External Fraud"" and the reference output says ""External Fraud"", it's likely a minor wording difference. The ""date"" and ""amount"" fields are correctly formatted, and the ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields."

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

The predicted output is a perfect match with the correct output. All global required fields are present and correctly formatted, including ""source"", ""fraud_type"", and ""alerted_transactions"". The ""police_reference"" and ""police_team"" fields are also present, which are conditionally required fields. The ""police_team"" field matches the ""police_team"" field in the correct output.

All per-transaction required fields are also correctly included and formatted for each transaction in the ""alerted_transactions"" array. The ""date"" fields follow a recognizable date format, the ""amount"" fields include both currency and numeric values, and the ""from"" and ""to"" objects contain the required fields. The ""channel"" field is not present in the correct output, which is acceptable since it is an optional field.

The predicted output is valid and structured JSON. The score is 1.0, indicating a perfect match with the correct output.","### Evaluation Output:

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

- The alerted_transactions array contains one transaction, which is present in the reference output.
- The transaction fields in the predicted output are mostly correct, with the exception of the order of 'from' and 'to' fields, which are swapped. This is considered a partial correctness issue.
- The score reflects the correctness of the overall structure and fields presence, with a deduction for the swapped transaction fields."

Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Evaluation Rationale
The predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects:

1.  **Global Required Fields:**
    *   `source` is equal to ""ADCC"", which is correct.
    *   `fraud_type` expresses the same meaning as the reference fraud type, ""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"", which is correct.
    *   `alerted_transactions` is present as an array, which is correct and contains one transaction.

2.  **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
    *   `police_reference` is present in the predicted output, which is correct.
    *   `police_team` is also present, which is correct.

3.  **Global Optional Fields:**
    *   `police_team` is present in the predicted output, which matches the reference output.

4.  **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
    *   Each transaction in `alerted_transactions` has:
        *   `date` in a recognizable date format (""2024-07-25""), which is correct.
        *   `amount` includes both currency (""HKD"") and numeric value (""135524""), which is correct.
        *   `from` and `to` objects are present with the required fields:
            *   `from` contains `name` (""TSANG SIU MING""), `account_number` (""66666666602""), which is correct.
            *   `to` contains `name` (""CHAN TAI MAN""), `account_number` (""111-111111-101""), and `bank` (""HSB""), which is correct.

- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.

### Reason
The predicted output matches the reference output perfectly, with no discrepancies found in the required fields or transaction details. The structure and values are identical, indicating a perfect match.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Reasoning:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - The predicted output includes all required fields at the top level: ""source"" and ""fraud_type"". However, ""fraud_type"" has a different value (""External Fraud"" instead of the expected ""External""). This is a semantic mismatch, but it's still considered correct because the predicted output conveys the same meaning. ""alerted_transactions"" is present as an array with one element.
   
2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - The predicted output includes all required fields for each transaction: ""date"", ""amount"", ""from"", and ""to"".
   - The ""date"" field is in a recognizable date format.
   - The ""amount"" field includes both currency and numeric value.
   - The ""from"" and ""to"" objects include the required fields: ""name"" and ""account_number"".
   - The ""bank"" field in the ""to"" object is present but has a different value (""ACSC"" instead of the expected value). However, ""ACSC"" is a valid bank name, so this is not considered an error.

3. **Evaluation Criteria:**
   - The field presence and structure align with the reference output.
   - The values match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
   - The predicted output is valid, structured JSON.

Given these points, the predicted output is considered satisfactory with a score of 1.0."

Explanation:

- The predicted output is valid and structured JSON, so it meets the first criterion.
- The source field is correct, and the fraud type is close enough to be considered correct, as ""External Fraud"" implies it's not internal, so the score for this field is 1.
- The alerted_transactions array is present, but it contains two transactions. For the first transaction, the date, amount, from.name, and to.name are correct. However, the to.account_number is missing. For the second transaction, the date and amount are correct, but the from object is missing the account_number, and the to.account_number is incorrect.
- Given the missing and incorrect fields, the score for each transaction is 0.5. The overall score is the average of the transaction scores, which is 0.5.

Note: This evaluation assumes that the missing or incorrect fields are due to minor formatting differences or omissions. If the predicted output contains significant errors, the score would be lower."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Reasoning:

The predicted output matches the correct output in all aspects:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source` is correctly set to ""Search Warrant"".
   - `fraud_type` is correctly set to ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", matching the semantic meaning.
   - `alerted_transactions` is present as an empty array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference` is present and matches the correct output.
   - `writ_no` is present and matches the correct output.
   - `contact_person` is present and matches the correct output.

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team` is present and matches the correct output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - There are no transactions in the `alerted_transactions` array, so no transactions are evaluated.

Since the predicted output is identical to the correct output, it meets all the evaluation criteria perfectly, resulting in a score of 1.0 and an ""is_satisfactory"" value of true."

3. In the ""to"" field, the ""name"" is missing, which is also conditionally required.

4. The ""date"" and ""amount"" fields are present and correctly formatted.

5. The ""channel"" field is present and correctly formatted.

6. The ""fraud_type"" field is present but its value does not exactly match the reference output. However, the meaning is the same, so it is considered correct in terms of semantics.

7. Since the predicted output is missing two required fields, it scores 0.5, which is the proportion of correctly matched fields out of the total required fields (2 out of 4).","### Evaluation Output

}
```

Explanation:

- The ""source"" field is present and correct, so it contributes to the score.
- The ""fraud_type"" field is present but has a minor difference in wording. However, the meaning is correct, so it contributes to the score.
- The ""alerted_transactions"" field is present as an array, so it contributes to the score.
- For the single transaction:
  - The ""date"" field is present and in a recognizable format, so it contributes to the score.
  - The ""amount"" field is missing currency, so it deducts from the score (0.2).
  - The ""from"" field is missing, so it deducts from the score (0.2).
  - The ""to"" field has an incorrect ""account_number"" but a correct ""channel"", so it deducts from the score (0.2).

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case Inspector CHAN ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,
  ""reason"": """",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}

### Rationale:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - **source:** ""Police Letter"" (matches)
   - **fraud_type:** ""Telephone Deception"" (matches in meaning, even though exact wording is not used)
   - **alerted_transactions:** Present as an array with one transaction (matches)

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **police_reference:** ""Policeref1"" (matches)
   - **police_team:** ""District Investigation Team 4"" (matches)

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - **police_team:** ""District Investigation Team 4"" (matches)

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - **date:** ""2024-05-22"" (matches a recognizable date format)
   - **amount:** ""3000-HKD"" (includes currency and numeric value)
   - **from:** Contains **account_number** and **bank** (matches)
   - **to:** Contains **account_number** and **name** (matches)
   - **channel:** Not present, which is acceptable since it's an optional field.

Given the predicted output aligns perfectly with the reference output, the score is 1.0, and it is considered satisfactory.","### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""Minor discrepancy in police_team field. Expected 'District Investigation Team 4' instead of 'District Investigation Team 4 Mong Kok District'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Explanation:

The predicted output is mostly satisfactory, with only a minor discrepancy in the `police_team` field. The predicted output includes all required fields, with the exception of the minor difference in the `police_team` name. The `fraud_type` field is correctly identified as ""Telephone Deception"" (with a semantic match), and the `alerted_transactions` array is present.

The `police_reference` field is correctly included, and the `police_team` field, although with a minor discrepancy, is still present. The `alerted_transactions` array contains one transaction, which is correctly structured with all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `to`, and `from`).

The score is 0.9, indicating a high level of correctness, with only a minor issue in the `police_team` field."
