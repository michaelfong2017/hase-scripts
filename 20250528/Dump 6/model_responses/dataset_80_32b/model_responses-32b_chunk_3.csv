HSBC Referral,5,"You are given the content of an HSBC Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:
