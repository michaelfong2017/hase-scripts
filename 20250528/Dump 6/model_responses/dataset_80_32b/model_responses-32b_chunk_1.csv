### Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Set to ""HSBC Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Set to ""Phishing Scam"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Contains an array of transaction objects.

2. **Per-Transaction Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to`.

3. **Normalization Rules**:
   - The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is normalized to ""HASE"" for the `from` object.
   - The `to` object retains the original bank name ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" since it does not match ""HSB"".

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
