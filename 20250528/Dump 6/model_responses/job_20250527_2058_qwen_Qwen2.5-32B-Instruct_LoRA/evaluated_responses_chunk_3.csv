1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Must always be ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Must exactly match the original input fraud type.
- alerted_transactions: Must be present as an array (can be empty, but never omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction in the alerted_transactions array must include:
- amount: Must include currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
Extract and include the following fields only if present in the input. Omit them entirely if missing or unknown.
- date: Format must be YYYY-MM-DD.
- from: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- to: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- channel: Optional string (e.g., ""FPS"", ""cash""). Only include if explicitly present.

4. Bank Name Normalization:
Normalize the values in from.bank and to.bank according to the following rules:
- ""HSB"" _ ""HASE""
- ""Hang Seng Bank"" _ ""HASE""
- ""HSBC"" and ""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation"" _ ""HSBC""

5. Omission and Formatting Rules:
- Do not include any fields that are missing or unknown in the original input.
- Do not include null, ""unknown"", or placeholders.
- Do not include extra or irrelevant fields.

6. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available valid fields from each transaction.
- Each transaction may include a different subset of fields depending on what is present in the input.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP SO ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

```","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following strict criteria:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Must always be ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Must exactly match the original input fraud type.
- alerted_transactions: Must be present as an array (can be empty, but never omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields:
If present in the input, the following fields must be extracted:
- police_reference: e.g., ""ESPS XXXX/2025 and KT RN XXXXXXXXXX""

3. Global Optional Fields:
If present in the input, include:
- police_team: e.g., ""DIT 3-XXXXXXXX""

4. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction in the alerted_transactions array must include:
- amount: Must include currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

5. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
Extract and include the following fields only if present in the input. Omit them entirely if missing or unknown.
- date: Format must be YYYY-MM-DD.
- from: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- to: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- channel: Optional string (e.g., ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""cheque""). Only include if explicitly present.

6. Bank Name Normalization:
Normalize the values in from.bank and to.bank according to the following rules:
- ""HSB"" _ ""HASE""
- ""Hang Seng Bank"" _ ""HASE""
- ""HSBC"" and ""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation"" _ ""HSBC""

7. Omission and Formatting Rules:
- Do not include any fields that are missing or unknown in the original input.
- Do not include null, ""unknown"", or placeholder values.
- Do not include extra fields that are not present in the input.

8. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available valid fields from each transaction.
- Each transaction may include a different subset of fields depending on what is present in the input.

Your Output Format:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true | false,
  ""reason"": ""Required only if is_satisfactory is false. Describe each failed criterion (e.g., 'Missing required field: police_reference', 'Incorrect bank normalization: HSB not converted to HASE')."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": integer, // total number of transactions in correct_output
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": integer // number of exact matches (field + value) between predicted and correct_output
}",Case_37_Suspect_1_Intelligence_1_ADCC.md,Case_37_IR.md,IR - C2537.docx,1,1,"Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here's the evaluation:

### Evaluation

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
   - `fraud_type`: The predicted output has ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"", while the correct output has ""Employment Fraud"". This discrepancy means the fraud type does not match the original input.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array and correctly formatted.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted.
   
3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly formatted.

4. **Per-Transaction Required Fields**:
   - `amount`: All transactions have the correct format with currency included.

5. **Per-Transaction Conditional Fields**:
   - `date`, `from`, and `to` fields are present and correctly formatted in all transactions.
   - `channel`: Not present in either the predicted or correct output, so this is correctly omitted.

6. **Bank Name Normalization**:
   - All bank names are correctly normalized to ""HASE"".

7. **Omission and Formatting Rules**:
   - No extra fields or placeholders are included.

8. **Extraction Principle**:
   - All available valid fields from each transaction are extracted correctly.

### Conclusion

The primary issue is the mismatch in the `fraud_type` field. Since this is a required field and must exactly match the original input, the output is not satisfactory.

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""reason"": ""Incorrect fraud_type: 'Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)' does not match the original 'Employment Fraud'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```","Based on the provided predicted output and the correct reference output, here is the assessment:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""reason"": ""Mismatch in fraud_type ('Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)' vs 'Employment Fraud'), Incorrect amount formatting (e.g., 'HKD55,100' vs 'HKD55100'), Missing 'name' field in 'to' object."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
   - `fraud_type`: Mismatch. The predicted output has ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" while the correct output has ""Employment Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted.
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly formatted.

3. **Per-Transaction Required Fields**:
   - `amount`: Incorrect formatting. The predicted output uses commas in the amount (e.g., ""HKD55,100"") while the correct output does not (e.g., ""HKD55100"").
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
   - `from` and `to` objects: Present and correctly formatted, but the `to` object is missing the `name` field.

4. **Omission and Formatting Rules**:
   - No extra fields included.
   - All required fields are present, but some are incorrectly formatted or missing necessary subfields.

Given these discrepancies, the predicted output is not satisfactory."
ADCC,14,"You are given the content of an ADCC case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields (must be included if the data exists in the input):
- police_reference: Extract police reference from the input (e.g., ""ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■"").

3. Global Optional Fields:
- police_team: Include if present (e.g., ""DIT 3-■■■■■"").

4. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

5. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, cheque, etc.). This field is optional per transaction.

6. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

7. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case IP YUEN ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

  ""source"": ""Victim ODFT"",
  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

```","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Victim ODFT case, assess the predicted output according to the following strict criteria:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Must always be ""Victim ODFT"".
- fraud_type: Must exactly match the original input fraud type.
- alerted_transactions: Must be present as an array (can be empty, but never omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction in the alerted_transactions array must include:
- amount: Must include currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
Extract and include the following fields only if present in the input. Omit them entirely if missing or unknown.
- date: Format must be YYYY-MM-DD.
- from: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- to: Object with any of the following subfields:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank
- channel: Optional string (e.g., ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""unknown""). Only include if explicitly present.

4. Bank Name Normalization:
Normalize the values in from.bank and to.bank according to the following rules:
- ""HSB"" _ ""HASE""
- ""Hang Seng Bank"" _ ""HASE""
- ""HSBC"" and ""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation"" _ ""HSBC""

5. Omission and Formatting Rules:
- Do not include any fields that are missing or unknown in the original input.
- Do not include null, ""unknown"", or placeholder values.
- Do not include extra fields that are not present in the input.

6. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available valid fields from each transaction.
- Each transaction may include a different subset of fields depending on what is present in the input.

Your Output Format:

{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true | false,
  ""reason"": ""Required only if is_satisfactory is false. Describe each failed criterion (e.g., 'Incorrect bank normalization: HSB not converted to HASE')."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": integer, // total number of transactions in correct_output
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": integer // number of exact matches (field + value) between predicted and correct_output
