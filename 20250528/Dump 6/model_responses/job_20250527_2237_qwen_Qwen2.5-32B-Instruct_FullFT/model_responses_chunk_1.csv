I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

#### **Evaluation Criteria**  
1. **Completeness**: All required fields must exist.  
2. **Accuracy**: Extracted values must match (case-sensitive not necessary).

Explanation:
- The `source` is ""Search Warrant"".
- The `police_reference` is extracted as ""POLICEREF1"".
- The `writ_no` is extracted as ""TM ■■■■"".
- The `contact_person` is extracted as ""PC ■■■■■"".
- The `police_team` is extracted as ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad Yuen Long District, Hong Kong Police Force"".
- The `fraud_type` is extracted as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"".
- There are no specific transactions provided in the input, hence `alerted_transactions` is an empty array."
HSBC Referral,34,"You are given the content of an HSBC Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

- source: Always ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:

- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".

- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

HSBC Referral,32,"You are given the content of an HSBC Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

1. Global Required Fields (must always appear at the top level):
- source: Always ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Exact fraud type from the input (e.g., ""Impersonation (Others)"").
- alerted_transactions: Array of transactions (empty if none).

2. Per-Transaction Required Fields:
Each transaction must include:
- amount: With currency (e.g., ""HKD50,000"").

3. Per-Transaction Conditional Fields:
For every transaction, extract all of the following fields if they are present in the input (omit if missing):
- date: In YYYY-MM-DD format.
- from: Object with any available of:
  - name: Sender's name.
  - account_number: Sender's account number.
  - bank: Sender's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- to: Object with any available of:
  - name: Recipient's name.
  - account_number: Recipient's account number.
  - bank: Recipient's bank. If the bank is ""HSB"", output as ""HASE"".
- channel: Payment method (e.g., FPS, cash, unknown). This field is optional per transaction.

4. Omission and Normalization Rules:
- Omit fields entirely if they are missing or unknown (do not use null or ""unknown"" as a value).
- Do not add fields not explicitly mentioned in the input.
- Normalize ""HSB"" to ""HASE"" for from.bank and to.bank only.

5. Extraction Principle:
- Extract all available data for each transaction.
- Different transactions may contain different subsets of fields.

Example:

Explanation:
1. The `source` is extracted directly from the input.
2. The `fraud_type` is extracted directly from the input.
3. The transaction details are extracted:
   - `date`: Extracted and formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.
   - `amount`: Extracted with currency.
   - `from` object includes:
     - `name`: Extracted.
     - `account_number`: Extracted.
     - `bank`: Normalized from ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" to ""HASE"".
   - `to` object includes:
     - `name`: Extracted.
     - `account_number`: Extracted.
     - `bank`: Kept as ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" since it does not need normalization."
