```","**Role**: You are an evaluation agent that strictly assesses JSON outputs for case extraction against ground truth. Your response must be in JSON format.  

#### **Evaluation Criteria**  
1. **Completeness**: All required fields must exist.  
2. **Accuracy**: Extracted values must match (case-sensitive not necessary).  
3. **Normalization**: Bank names must follow:  
   - `""HSB""` _ `""HASE""`  
   - `""Hang Seng Bank""` _ `""HASE""`  
   - `""HSBC""` _ `""HSBC""` (no change)  
   - `""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation""` _ `""HSBC""`  
4. **Transaction Integrity**: Each transaction must include all required fields (e.g., `amount`, `from`, `to`).  
5. ""source"" should always be ""Internal Referral"". ""fraud_type"" and ""alerted_transactions"" should always be a field as well as source. 

#### **Inputs**  
```json

  ""generated_output"": {GENERATED_OUTPUT},
  ""correct_output"": {CORRECT_OUTPUT}

#### **Output Format**  
```json

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Please be informed of a case of **""Investment (Online Gambling Website)""** reported on **2024-09-03** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 5-■■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

- **Global Optional Fields**: The `police_team` field is included as it is present in the input.
- **Per-Transaction Fields**: There are no specific transactions detailed in the input, hence the `alerted_transactions` array is empty.

```","**Role**: You are an evaluation agent that strictly assesses JSON outputs for case extraction against ground truth. Your response must be in JSON format.  

#### **Evaluation Criteria**  
1. **Completeness**: All required fields must exist.  
2. **Accuracy**: Extracted values must match (case-sensitive not necessary).  
3. **Normalization**: Bank names must follow:  
   - `""HSB""` _ `""HASE""`  
   - `""Hang Seng Bank""` _ `""HASE""`  
   - `""HSBC""` _ `""HSBC""` (no change)  
   - `""Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation""` _ `""HSBC""`  
4. **Transaction Integrity**: Each transaction must include all required fields (e.g., `amount`, `from`, `to`).  
5. ""source"" should always be ""Internal Referral"". ""fraud_type"" and ""alerted_transactions"" should always be a field as well as source. 

#### **Inputs**  
```json

  ""generated_output"": {GENERATED_OUTPUT},
  ""correct_output"": {CORRECT_OUTPUT}

#### **Output Format**  
```json

  ""is_satisfactory"": ""True if ALL criteria are met, otherwise False"",
  ""reason"": ""Only if is_satisfactory=False. Specify which criteria failed (e.g., 'Incorrect bank normalization: HSB not converted to HASE')"",

  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": ""Number of transactions matching exactly (fields + values)""
