}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here’s the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""External Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference (""2025-01-04"").
   - `amount`: Correctly formatted and matches the reference (""HKD 45,500.00"").
   - `from`:
     - `name`: Correctly identified as ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - `account_number`: Incorrect value (""111-111111-101"" instead of ""333-333333-101"").
     - `bank`: Empty in both, which is acceptable since no bank name was provided.
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Missing in the prediction but should be ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - `account_number`: Missing in the prediction but should be ""111-111111-101"".
     - `bank`: Empty in both, which is acceptable since no bank name was provided.
   - `channel`: Correctly identified as ""FPS"".

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output is mostly correct, but there are discrepancies in the `from` and `to` fields' account numbers and missing `to.name`.
   - The overall structure and most values match correctly, but the account number mismatch in the `from` field and the absence of `to.name` and `to.account_number` reduce the accuracy.

Given this analysis, here is the evaluation output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The account number in the 'from' field and the 'to' fields (name and account_number) are incorrect or missing."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects partial correctness due to the mismatches and missing fields, despite the majority of the data being accurately captured."

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly set to ""External Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - **First Transaction**:
     - `date`: Correct (`2025-01-03`).
     - `amount`: Correct (`HKD 32,300.00`).
     - `from`: Correct.
     - `to`: The name is correct (`CHAN TAI MAN`), but the `account_number` is different (`024-■■■■■■■■■■■` vs `111-111111-101`). This discrepancy causes partial correctness.
     - `channel`: Present as ""FPS"", but this detail is optional and not part of the reference output, so it doesn't affect correctness negatively.
   
   - **Second Transaction**:
     - This transaction is not present in the reference output. It introduces additional information that was not specified in the correct output.

Given these points, the first transaction is partially correct due to the account number mismatch, and the second transaction is entirely extraneous. Thus, only one out of two transactions is correct, leading to a score of 0.75."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Employment Fraud"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF3"").

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit"").

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2025-01-02"").
  - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HK$4000"").
  - `from`: Present and contains all necessary fields (`bank` and `account_number`) with correct values.
  - `channel`: Present and correctly set to an empty string, which is acceptable since it's optional.

The predicted output matches the reference output perfectly, both in structure and content, without any discrepancies. Therefore, the output is satisfactory with a full score.","Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match semantically with the reference output ('Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime' vs 'Employment Fraud'). All other fields are correctly present and structured, with minor formatting differences acceptable."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Does not semantically match the reference (""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"" vs ""Employment Fraud""). This is a significant discrepancy.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array containing one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Correctly present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value. The format difference (4000 HKD vs HK$4000) is minor and acceptable.
   - `from`:
     - `account_number`: Present and matches the reference output.
     - `bank`: Present and matches the reference output (BOC).
   
Given these points, the main issue lies in the mismatch of `fraud_type`, which significantly impacts the overall accuracy of the output. All other fields are correctly handled, leading to a partial correctness score."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

#### Global Required Fields
- **source**: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
- **fraud_type**: Correctly identified as ""External Fraud"". 
- **alerted_transactions**: Present as an array containing one transaction.

#### Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields
- **date**: Correctly formatted as ""2024-11-12"".
- **amount**: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 77,000.00"".
- **from**: Contains correct `name` and `account_number`.
- **to**: Present but empty in the predicted output, while it contains `name` and `account_number` in the reference output.
- **channel**: Correctly identified as ""FPS"".

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Field Presence and Structure**: All required fields are present and correctly structured.
- **Values Matching Semantically**: Values are consistent between the predicted and reference outputs except for the `to` field.
- **Fraud Type**: Matches semantically.
- **Bank Names**: Not applicable in this case.
- **Partial Correctness**: The `to` field is missing information in the predicted output.

#### Scores and Reasoning
- **Score**: 0.8
- **Reason**: The predicted output is largely correct, but it lacks the `name` and `account_number` in the `to` object, which results in partial correctness.
- **Number of Transactions Total**: 1
- **Number of Transactions Correct**: 0.8 (partial correctness due to missing `to` details)

### Final Output

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

### Assessment:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Romance Scam"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with four transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly set to ""POLICEREF1"".

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly set to ""District Investigation Team 5"".

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, and `from` object.
   - However, the `to` object is missing in the predicted output, which is present in the reference output.

5. **Field Presence and Structure**:
   - The predicted output matches the reference output in terms of `date`, `amount`, and `from` fields within each transaction.
   - The `amount` field has minor formatting differences (HKD vs HK$), which are acceptable.
   - The `to` object is missing entirely, leading to incorrectness in those fields.

### Evaluation:
- **Score**: 0.75
- **Reason**: The predicted output is mostly correct except for the absence of the `to` object in all transactions, which is present in the reference output.
- **Number of Transactions Total**: 4
- **Number of Transactions Correct**: 0 (since the `to` object is missing in all transactions)

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to' object is missing in all transactions, leading to partial correctness."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

This score reflects that while most of the required fields and structures are correct, the absence of the `to` object significantly impacts the overall accuracy.","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here's the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present but incorrect (""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"" vs ""Romance Scam"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 5"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted in all transactions.
   - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted in all transactions, though there are minor differences in commas.
   - `from`: Present and correctly formatted in all transactions.
   - `to`: Missing in all transactions.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output is missing the `to` field in all transactions, which is present in the reference output.
   - The `fraud_type` does not match the reference output semantically.

Given the above points, the evaluation is as follows:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' field does not match the reference output semantically, and the 'to' field is missing in all transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects that while most of the required fields are present and correctly formatted, the critical mismatch in `fraud_type` and the absence of the `to` field significantly impact the accuracy."

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

   - `writ_no`: Correctly included.
   - `contact_person`: Correctly included.

3. **Global Optional Fields:**

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - For the single transaction object in `alerted_transactions`:
     - `date`: Missing.
     - `amount`: Missing.
     - `from`: Contains only `account_number`, missing `name` and `bank`.
     - `to`: Missing entirely.
     - `channel`: Missing.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  - For the single transaction in the predicted output:
    - `amount`: Present and correct (""HKD 130000"").
    - `from`: Present with `name` (""張先生"").
    - `to`: Present with `name` (""第三者戶口"").
    - `date`: Not present in either the predicted or reference output, so this is not an issue.
    - `channel`: Not present in either the predicted or reference output, so this is not an issue.

- **Additional Observations**:
  - The predicted output includes additional details like `description`, which is not part of the reference output. This does not affect the evaluation negatively.
  - The reference output includes two transactions, while the predicted output only captures one of them. This is a significant discrepancy.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.5,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output is missing one transaction present in the reference output. While the global fields and the included transaction details are correct, the completeness of the transactions list is crucial."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Summary:
The predicted output correctly captures the global fields and details of one transaction but misses another transaction entirely, leading to an unsatisfactory score."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an HSBC Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""HSBC Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

}","Based on the given predicted output and the correct reference output, here is the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly set to ""External Fraud"" which matches semantically.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction object.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2025-01-04"".
   - `amount`: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 40,012.00"".
   - `from` and `to` objects:
     - Both have `name` and `account_number` fields.
     - However, the `account_number` values for `from` and `to` are swapped in the predicted output compared to the correct output.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The predicted output is mostly correct, except for the swap of `account_number` values between the `from` and `to` objects.

Given these points, the evaluation output is:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The account numbers for 'from' and 'to' are swapped, leading to partial incorrectness."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Explanation:
- The score is 0.8 because most fields are correctly represented, but there is a significant error in the `account_number` fields.
- The `number_of_transactions_total` is 1, and since the transaction details are not fully correct due to the swap, `number_of_transactions_correct` is 0."
Internal Referral,37,"You are given the content of an Internal Referral case. Extract and summarize the information into JSON. Follow these rules:

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case ADC Kwan ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:

- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source`: Correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Investment Scam"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array containing one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output.

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format (""2024-07-26"").
  - `amount`: Present and includes currency and numeric value. The format varies slightly (""10000 HKD"" vs ""HK$10000""), but this minor difference is acceptable.
  - `from`: Contains both `bank` and `account_number`, which match the reference.
  - `to`: Contains both `account_number` and `name`, which match the reference.

### Summary:
The predicted output meets all the required criteria and closely aligns with the reference output. There are no significant discrepancies in the values provided, and the structure is valid and consistent.

**Evaluation Output:**

  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 1.0,

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields:**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Investment Scam"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and is an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields:**
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
   - `date`: Present and correct (""2024-07-26"").
   - `amount`: Present and correct (""HK$10000"").
   - `from`: Present and correct (account_number ""66666666601"", bank ""CCB"").
   - `to`: Missing in the predicted output but present in the correct output.

5. **Additional Notes:**
   - The `to` object is missing in the predicted output, which results in partial correctness.

### Evaluation Score Calculation:
- The `to` object is missing, which is a significant part of the transaction details.
- All other fields are correctly present and formatted.

Given these points, the predicted output is partially correct but lacks the `to` object within the transaction.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to' object is missing in the transaction details, which affects the completeness of the transaction data."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects the missing `to` object, which is crucial for the transaction details. Thus, the overall transaction is not considered fully correct."

}

### Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"".
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with two transactions.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Incorrect year (2024 instead of 2023) for both transactions.
  - `amount`: Correctly formatted and matching the reference.
  - `from`: Both `name` and `account_number` match the reference.
  - `channel`: Correctly set to ""Others"" for both transactions.

Since the dates are incorrect, none of the transactions are fully correct, leading to a lower score despite other fields being accurate.","Based on the given predicted and correct outputs, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Victim ODFT"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Impersonation"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - For each transaction:
     - `date`: Present and in a recognizable date format. However, the year is incorrect (2024 instead of 2023).
     - `amount`: Present and includes currency and numeric value.
     - `from`: Present and contains the correct `name` and `account_number`.
     - `channel`: Present but incorrect (""ATM"" instead of ""Others"").

### Evaluation Output

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The year in the 'date' field is incorrect for both transactions, and the 'channel' field is wrong for both transactions. These inaccuracies result in a lower score."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 2,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Explanation

- The `source` and `fraud_type` fields are correctly identified and formatted.
- Both transactions have all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`, and `channel`), but there are inaccuracies:
  - The year in the `date` field is off by one year.
  - The `channel` field is incorrect (""ATM"" instead of ""Others"").
- Due to these errors, no transaction is considered fully correct, leading to a score of 0.75. The deductions are mainly due to the incorrect year and channel type."

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:

   - `fraud_type`: Missing in the predicted output. This is a critical error since it is a required field.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array, though it contains an incomplete transaction object.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""POLICEREF2"").

   - `contact_person`: Present and correct (""PC ■■■■■"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The transaction object within `alerted_transactions` is present but incomplete:

     - `amount`: Missing.
     - `from`: Contains `account_number`, which is correct.
     - `to`: Empty object, which is acceptable if no information was provided.
     - `channel`: Missing.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Field presence and structure generally align, but there are significant missing values.
   - The `fraud_type` is completely missing, which is a major issue.
   - The transaction details are incomplete, leading to partial correctness.

### Evaluation Output:

### Explanation:
- **Score**: 0.6 because while most global fields are correctly present, the critical `fraud_type` field is missing, and the transaction data is incomplete.
- **Reason**: Highlights the missing `fraud_type` and incomplete transaction details.
- **Number of Transactions**: There is one transaction object in the predicted output, but none are fully correct due to missing fields."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Evaluation Output:

```json

  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match semantically with the reference output. The predicted fraud type 'Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime' does not correspond to the reference fraud type 'Bounced Cheque'. All other fields and structures are correctly represented."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect. The predicted output states ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"", which does not semantically match ""Bounced Cheque"". This is a significant mismatch.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array containing one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output (""POLICEREF1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2025-01-03"").
   - `amount`: Present but lacks the currency indicator ""HKD"". The predicted output has ""20000"", while the correct output specifies ""20000 HKD"".
   - `from`: Present and correctly contains the `account_number` and `bank`.
   - `to`: Present and correctly contains the `name` and `account_number`.

Given these points, the predicted output mostly aligns with the reference output except for the critical mismatch in `fraud_type` and the minor formatting issue in `amount`. Thus, the overall score is 0.75, reflecting partial correctness with a significant deduction for the incorrect `fraud_type`."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,

### Explanation:
1. **Global Required Fields**: 
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Investment Scam"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted.
   - `amount`: Present but missing the currency symbol (HK$). This is a minor formatting issue but impacts the score.
   - `from`: Present but does not match the reference output (missing `name` and `account_number`).
   - `to`: Not present in either the predicted or correct output, so this is not an issue.
   - `channel`: Missing in the predicted output, which is a significant issue as it was present in the reference output.

Given these points, the overall score reflects the partial correctness of the fields while penalizing the absence of the `channel` field and the incorrect formatting of the `amount`.","### Evaluation:

- **Global Required Fields:**
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and semantically correct (""Investment Scam"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""TSW RN 240■■■■■■■"").

- **Global Optional Fields:**
  - `police_team`: Present but contains extra information (""District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District"" vs ""District Investigation Team 3""). This is slightly incorrect but close enough.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields:**
  - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-08-26"").
  - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted (""HK$50,000"" vs ""HK$50000""). Minor formatting difference is acceptable.
  - `from`: Present but incomplete (missing ""account_number"", ""name""). Only ""bank"" is present, which is acceptable.
  - `to`: Missing, but not required in this case.
  - `channel`: Missing, but it exists in the reference output and should have been included.

### Evaluation Output:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'police_team' has extra information, and the 'channel' field is missing from the transaction data. These discrepancies reduce the overall accuracy."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The `police_team` field includes extra information (""Yuen Long District""), which is not present in the reference output.
- The `channel` field is missing in the transaction data, which is present in the reference output.
- The `from` object lacks `name` and `account_number`, though it includes the `bank`.
- The `amount` format is slightly different but acceptable.

Overall, the predicted output is mostly accurate but falls short due to these issues. Hence, the score is 0.75, and it is not satisfactory."

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Evaluation

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Internal Referral"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly set to ""External Fraud"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction object.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2024-07-10"".
   - `amount`: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 1.00"".
   - `from`:
     - `name`: Correctly set to ""MISS YEUNG KAI"".
     - `account_number`: Present in the predicted output but not in the correct output. This is extra information which does not affect correctness negatively.
   - `to`:
     - `name`: Correctly set to ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
     - `account_number`: Present in the correct output but the redaction pattern differs slightly in the predicted output (""01211■■■■■■■"" vs ""111-111111-101""). However, since the pattern is consistent and the first part of the account number matches, this can be considered correct.
   - `channel`: Correctly set to ""FPS"".

### Score Breakdown
- All global required fields are correctly present and structured.
- All per-transaction conditionally required fields are correctly present and structured.
- There are no significant discrepancies in the values or their semantic meaning.

### Evaluation Output

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an ADCC case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""ADCC"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

Note that the police_team field is not included in the output as the information is not explicitly mentioned in the input. Also, the channel field is not included as it is not present in the input.","Based on the provided reference output and the predicted output, here is the evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present in the predicted output but includes additional information (""ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)""). The reference only has ""KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)"", which is part of the predicted output, so this is partially correct.
   
3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""DIT 2 ■■■■■■"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction contains all required fields (`date`, `amount`, `from`, `to`), and the values match the reference output, except for minor formatting differences in the `amount` field (e.g., commas in ""HKD 55,100"" vs ""HKD 55100""). These minor differences are acceptable.

### Evaluation Summary:

- **Field presence and structure**: All required fields are present and structured correctly.
- **Values**: Most values match semantically, with minor formatting differences allowed.
- **Fraud Type**: Matches semantically.
- **Bank Names**: Correctly represented as ""HSB"".
- **Police Reference**: Contains additional information which is not present in the reference output, making it partially incorrect.

### Final Assessment:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""The police_reference field contains additional information not present in the reference output."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 4
}
```

The predicted output is mostly correct, with the exception of the `police_reference` field containing extra information. This minor discrepancy results in a slight deduction in the overall score.","### Evaluation:

To evaluate the predicted output against the correct reference output, we will check the adherence to the guidelines provided:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Present and correct (""ADCC"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and contains transactions.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)""). Note that the extra reference ""ESPS ■■/2025"" is unnecessary but does not affect the core information.

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Not included, which is correct since it was not specified in the input.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - Each transaction includes:
     - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
     - `amount`: Present and includes currency and numeric value, with minor formatting differences (comma in the number).
     - `from` and `to` objects: Present and contain the necessary fields (`name`, `account_number`, `bank`), with correct information.
   
   However, there is one discrepancy in the last transaction's `to` object:
   - The reference output has ""CHAN TAI MAN"" as the recipient, whereas the predicted output has ""CHUNG SIU"".

### Summary:
- **Field Presence**: All required fields are present.
- **Semantic Match**: The semantic content matches, with minor formatting differences.
- **Transaction Accuracy**: Three out of four transactions are correct.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""One transaction has incorrect recipient name 'CHUNG SIU' instead of 'CHAN TAI MAN'. This affects the overall accuracy."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 4,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 3
}
```

The score reflects that while most fields are correctly populated, there is a critical error in one of the transactions, leading to a deduction in the overall score."

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP TSANG ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:

- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria

- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.

}","Based on the provided predicted and correct outputs, here's the assessment:

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: The predicted output states ""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"", which does not semantically match ""Telephone Deception"" from the reference output.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output.

3. **Global Optional Fields**
   - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
   - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value.
   - `from`: Present and contains `bank` and `account_number`, matching the reference output.
   - `to`: Missing in the predicted output, which is present in the reference output and contains `account_number` and `name`.

5. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - The predicted output lacks the `to` object within the transaction, which is present in the reference output.
   - The `fraud_type` is incorrect semantically.

Given these points, the evaluation output would be:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.75,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match the reference semantically, and the 'to' field is missing in the transactions."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

Explanation:
- The overall structure and most fields are correctly captured, but there are significant issues with `fraud_type` and the missing `to` field in the transaction data.
- The score reflects partial correctness, considering the missing critical fields and semantic mismatch."

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

Note that the `police_team` field is not included as it is not explicitly mentioned in the input text. Also, the `channel` field is not included as it is not present in the input.","### Evaluation:

- **Global Required Fields**: 
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identifies the fraud type as ""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"".
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and matches the reference output.

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Present and matches the reference output.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Present and follows a recognizable date format.
  - `amount`: Present and includes both currency and numeric value.
  - `from`: Contains `name` and `account_number`. The `bank` field is present but not required.
  - `to`: Contains `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`.
  - `channel`: Present but optional.

### Deductions:
- The `from.bank` field in the predicted output is not required since it was not present in the reference output. This is a minor inconsistency but does not significantly impact the overall correctness.

### Final Assessment:
- **Score**: 0.95
- **Reason**: The predicted output closely matches the reference output, with the exception of the unnecessary inclusion of `bank` under the `from` object which is not present in the reference.

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.95,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from.bank' field is present in the predicted output but not in the reference, which is a minor inconsistency."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```","### Evaluation:

Based on the given criteria, here is the assessment of the predicted output:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""ADCC"".
   - `fraud_type`: Semantically correct (""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly structured as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted. However, the predicted output does not include the full reference as in the correct output (`ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 5-■■■■■■■)`), but only part of it (`DIT 5-■■■■■■■`).

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Not present in the predicted output, which is acceptable since it is optional and not explicitly mentioned in the input text.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2024-07-25"".
   - `amount`: Correctly formatted as ""HKD 135,524"" (minor difference in formatting compared to the reference).
   - `from`: Contains `name` and `account_number`, which are correct.
   - `to`: Contains `name`, `account_number`, and `bank`. The bank name ""HSB"" matches semantically with ""HSBC"".

5. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - The overall structure and presence of required fields are correct.
   - The `police_reference` is partially correct but missing additional details.
   - The `amount` has a minor formatting difference but is otherwise correct.
   - The bank name ""HSB"" is accepted as an abbreviation for ""HSBC"".

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": true,
  ""score"": 0.9,
  ""reason"": ""The 'police_reference' field is partially correct, missing additional details. Minor formatting differences in 'amount' are noted."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects the high degree of accuracy but accounts for the partial correctness of the `police_reference` field and minor formatting differences in the `amount`."

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correct (""Search Warrant"").
   - `fraud_type`: Correct (""Obtaining Property By Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Correct (""KTRN230■■■■"").
   - `writ_no`: Correct (""8■■■"").
   - `contact_person`: Correct (""PC 1■■■■"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Missing in the predicted output, but present in the reference.

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - The reference output has an empty `alerted_transactions` array, while the predicted output incorrectly includes transaction details that do not exist in the reference.

Given these points, the predicted output has correctly captured most of the required fields but failed to maintain the correct structure for `alerted_transactions` and missed an optional but present field (`police_team`). Therefore, the overall score is 0.75, reflecting partial correctness."

Explanation:
- **Global Required Fields**: All required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are correctly included.
- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**: Most fields match the reference, except for the `to.account_number` discrepancy and the inclusion of the optional `channel` field.
- **Field Presence and Structure**: The structure is correct, but the `channel` field introduces an inconsistency with the reference.
- **Values**: Most values are semantically correct, but the redaction in `to.account_number` is incorrect compared to the reference.

Given these points, the overall score reflects partial correctness with noted deductions."

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for an Internal Referral case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Internal Referral"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Accept equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

3. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**
   - The first transaction in the predicted output matches the reference output correctly.
   - The second transaction in the predicted output introduces an additional transaction that is not present in the reference output.

These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Search Warrant"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference
- writ_no
- contact_person

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor differences in formatting (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

### Evaluation:
- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Present and correct (""Search Warrant"").
  - `fraud_type`: Present and correct (""Obtaining Property By Deception"").
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array, although it contains one transaction object which is not present in the reference output (which has an empty array).

- **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""TSWRN240■■■■"").
  - `writ_no`: Present and correct (""TM12■■■/2024"").
  - `contact_person`: Present and correct (""SGT 2■■■■"").

- **Global Optional Fields**:
  - `police_team`: Not present in the predicted output, but it exists in the reference output. This is not a requirement since it's optional.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - The reference output has an empty `alerted_transactions` array, whereas the predicted output contains one transaction object. Since the reference does not require any transaction details, the presence of this transaction object in the predicted output is not aligned with the reference output.

### Score Breakdown:
- The predicted output correctly captures all required fields and conditionally required fields.
- However, the inclusion of a transaction object when the reference output specifies an empty array for `alerted_transactions` leads to a minor inconsistency.

### Final Assessment:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The predicted output includes a transaction object in 'alerted_transactions', while the reference output specifies an empty array for this field."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 0,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

### Notes:
- The score reflects the minor discrepancy regarding the `alerted_transactions` field.
- The overall structure and most of the content are correct, hence the high score.
- The `police_team` field is optional and its absence does not impact the score significantly."

### Evaluation

- **Global Required Fields**:
  - `source`: Correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
  - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"".
  - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

- **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
  - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2024-09-11"".
  - `amount`: Correctly listed as ""980000"". However, it lacks the currency symbol which is present in the reference.
  - `from`: Present in the predicted output, but the reference output specifies this information under the `to` field.
  - `to`: Missing in the predicted output, while the reference includes both `name` and `account_number`.
  - `channel`: Correctly specified as ""Others"".

### Deductions:
- The `amount` field is missing the currency symbol (assumed to be a minor formatting issue).
- The `from` object is incorrectly used instead of the `to` object, which is crucial since it contains the intended recipient details.
- The `to` object is completely missing, which is a significant discrepancy.

Given these points, the overall accuracy is reduced due to the incorrect placement of `from/to` and the missing currency symbol.

### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""The 'from' field is incorrectly used instead of the 'to' field, and the 'to' field is missing entirely. Additionally, the 'amount' field lacks the currency symbol."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 0
}
```

The score reflects partial correctness in some fields but significant errors in others, leading to an unsatisfactory evaluation.","Based on the provided reference and predicted outputs, here is the evaluation:

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly set to ""Victim ODFT"".
   - `fraud_type`: Correctly identified as ""Impersonation"".
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array.

2. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Correctly formatted as ""2024-09-11"".
   - `amount`: Present but lacks currency. The reference does not include currency, so this is acceptable.
   - `from`: Present but includes only `account_number`. The reference specifies `to` instead of `from`, which is a discrepancy.
   - `channel`: Correctly identified as ""Others"".

### Deductions:
- The `to` object is missing from the predicted output, while it is present in the reference output. This is a significant discrepancy.
- The `from` object in the predicted output incorrectly contains the `account_number` instead of the `to` object details.

### Score Calculation:
- The overall structure and most fields are correctly identified.
- However, the incorrect placement of `account_number` under `from` instead of `to` and the missing `name` field under `to` are notable errors.

Given these points, the evaluation is as follows:

```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.6,
  ""reason"": ""The 'to' object is missing in the predicted output, and the 'account_number' is incorrectly placed under 'from'. These discrepancies significantly affect the accuracy of the transaction details."",

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

}","You are an evaluation agent. Given the predicted JSON output and the correct reference output for a Police Letter case, assess the predicted output according to the following guidelines:

1. Global Required Fields  
These fields should always appear at the top level:
- source: Should be equal to ""Police Letter"".
- fraud_type: Should express the same meaning as the reference fraud type. Exact wording is not required.
- alerted_transactions: Should be present as an array (can be empty, but should not be omitted).

2. Global Conditionally Required Fields  
If the following fields exist in the reference output, they should also be present in the predicted output:
- police_reference

3. Global Optional Fields  
Include only if present in the reference output:
- police_team

4. Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields  
For each transaction, the following fields should be included if present in the reference:
- date: Should follow a recognizable date format. Minor format variations are acceptable.
- amount: Should include both currency and numeric value. Minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing, punctuation, hyphens, decimal places) are acceptable.
- from: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- to: Object that may contain any of:
  - name
  - account_number
  - bank: Allow equivalent names or abbreviations for the same institution.
- channel: Optional field indicating the payment method.

5. Evaluation Criteria  
- Field presence and structure should align with the reference output.
- Values should match semantically, even if formatting or wording differs.
- fraud_type is evaluated by meaning, not by exact string match.
- Bank names can be matched based on known aliases or abbreviations.
- Partial correctness is acceptable and should be reflected in the score.
- The predicted output should be valid, structured JSON.

This JSON output includes the required and conditionally required fields as per the given rules. The `fraud_type` is set to ""Money Laundering"" based on the context of the police letter. The `police_reference` and `police_team` are included as they are present in the input. The `alerted_transactions` array contains a single transaction with the relevant details extracted from the table in the police letter.","Based on the provided guidelines, here is the evaluation of the predicted output compared to the correct reference output:

### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**
   - `source`: Present and correct (""Police Letter"").
   - `fraud_type`: Present but incorrect meaning (""Might have been used in receiving proceeds of crime"" vs ""Telephone Deception"").
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present as an array with one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `police_reference`: Present and correct (""Policeref1"").

3. **Global Optional Fields**
   - `police_team`: Present and correct (""District Investigation Team 4"").

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted (""2024-05-22"").
   - `amount`: Present but has minor formatting differences (""$3000-HKD"" vs ""3000-HKD"").
   - `from` and `to`: Both objects are present and contain correct information, although the order of attributes within these objects is different.

### Deductions:
- The `fraud_type` does not semantically match the reference output, which significantly impacts the overall accuracy.
- The `amount` has a minor formatting difference with the inclusion of a dollar sign.

### Score Calculation:
- **Field Presence and Structure**: All required fields are present and correctly structured.
- **Values Matching Semantically**: Most values match semantically, except for the `fraud_type`.
- **Transactions**: There is one transaction, and it is mostly correct with only minor formatting issues.

Given the significant mismatch in `fraud_type`, the score will be reduced accordingly.

### Final Evaluation:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' does not match the reference output semantically. There is also a minor formatting issue with the 'amount'."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

This score reflects the overall accuracy of the predicted output while accounting for the critical semantic mismatch in `fraud_type`.","### Evaluation:

1. **Global Required Fields**:
   - `source`: Correctly provided as ""Police Letter"".
   - `fraud_type`: Incorrect. The predicted output states ""Money Laundering"", while the correct output specifies ""Telephone Deception"". This is a significant discrepancy.
   - `alerted_transactions`: Present and correctly formatted as an array containing one transaction.

2. **Global Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `police_reference`: Present and correctly formatted as ""Policeref1"".

3. **Global Optional Fields**:
   - `police_team`: Present and correctly formatted as ""District Investigation Team 4"".

4. **Per-Transaction Conditionally Required Fields**:
   - `date`: Present and correctly formatted as ""2024-05-22"".
   - `amount`: Present and correctly formatted as ""3000 HKD"". The minor difference in formatting (""3000-HKD"") does not affect the overall correctness.
   - `from`: Contains `bank` and `account_number`, which are correctly mapped.
   - `to`: Contains `name` and `account_number`, which are correctly mapped.

### Summary:
The predicted output has some inaccuracies primarily due to the incorrect `fraud_type`. All other fields are correctly identified and formatted, including the transaction details. 

#### Evaluation Output:
```json
{
  ""is_satisfactory"": false,
  ""score"": 0.8,
  ""reason"": ""The 'fraud_type' field is incorrect. It should be 'Telephone Deception' instead of 'Money Laundering'. Other fields are correctly identified and formatted."",
  ""number_of_transactions_total"": 1,
  ""number_of_transactions_correct"": 1
}
```

The score reflects the high accuracy in most fields but penalizes the critical error in the `fraud_type` field."
