Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/users/1787/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Note: The reason includes both account number normalization and bank normalization issues, even though only the account number issue was directly related to the provided criteria. Since the question does not specify how to handle partial failures, I've included both discrepancies. If only one type of discrepancy is needed, please clarify. However, based on the criteria provided, the account number discrepancy is the primary issue here. Thus, a more focused output would be:

```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": false,
  "reason": "Incorrect account number normalization: '01211■■■■■■■' should be '01211-123456-101'",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 1,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0
}
``` 

This reflects the specific issue with the account number normalization as per the given criteria.', Judgment Final = ' The bank name "HASE" has been correctly normalized, and all transactions are fully detailed.

The `number_of_transactions_total` reflects the number of transactions found in the given response. Since no `correct_output` was provided, the `number_of_transactions_correct` is set to `0`.

**Explanation**: 
- The fields `police_reference` and `police_team` are present but not required according to the criteria.
- The `from.name` and `to.channel` fields are missing in the transaction details.
- The `alerted_transactions` structure is present, but the required fields within each transaction are not complete, leading to zero correct transactions. 

Therefore, the output does not meet the criteria. The reason includes both the unnecessary fields and the missing required fields within the transaction details. The total number of transactions is correctly identified as one, but none of them are correct due to missing fields.'
