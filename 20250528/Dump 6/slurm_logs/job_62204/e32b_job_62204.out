### Explanation:
- **Source Field**: The generated output has `"source": "HSBC Referral"`, but the correct output specifies `"source": "ADCC"`.
- **Bank Normalization**: The generated output has `"bank": "HASE"` for the `from` account, but it should be `"bank": "HSBC"` based on the normalization rules provided.
- **Number of Transactions**: There is only one transaction in both the generated and correct outputs, but due to the above issues, no transaction matches exactly. Hence, the number of transactions correct is 0. 

Thus, the output is not satisfactory.'

{
  "is_satisfactory": false,
  "reason": "Incorrect bank normalization: 'HANG SENG BANK LTD.' in to.bank should be 'HASE', 'HASE' in from.bank should be 'HSBC'",

  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0

```', Judgment Final = ' Also, `bank` is normalized to the standard format. The `fraud_type` and `alerted_transactions` fields are included as required.

**Output**:

  "number_of_transactions_total": 1,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0
}
``` 

**Reasoning**:
- The `source` field is incorrect; it should be "HSBC Referral" but is "ADCC" in the generated output.
- The bank name in the `to` section should be normalized to "HASE", but it is still "HANG SENG BANK LTD." in the generated output. 
- The number of transactions total is 1, and since none of the transactions match the correct output, the number of transactions correct is 0. Thus, the output is not satisfactory.
