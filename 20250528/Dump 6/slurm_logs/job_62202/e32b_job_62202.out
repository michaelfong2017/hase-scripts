Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/users/1787/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

``` 

Note: The provided generated output does not contain the "source" field, which is a requirement according to the criteria. Therefore, the output is not satisfactory. The number of transactions total is correctly identified as 1, but none of them are correct due to the missing "source" field. The "fraud_type" field is also missing in the generated output, further contributing to the failure. The banks were correctly normalized, but the absence of mandatory fields leads to an unsatisfactory result.'
