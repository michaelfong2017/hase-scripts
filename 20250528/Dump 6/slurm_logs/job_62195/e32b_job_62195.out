Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/users/1787/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

**Evaluation**:
```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": false,
  "reason": "Incorrect bank normalization: 'HANG SENG BANK LTD.' in to.bank should be 'HASE'",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 1,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0
}
``` 

**Reasoning**: The `to.bank` value is incorrectly normalized as "HANG SENG BANK LTD." instead of "HASE". This violates the normalization criteria, making the output unsatisfactory. Therefore, the `is_satisfactory` flag is set to `false`. Since there is only one transaction, and it does not fully match the correct output, `number_of_transactions_correct` is `0`. The total number of transactions is `1`.'
