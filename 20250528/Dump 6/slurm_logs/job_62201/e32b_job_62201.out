[2025-05-27 18:00:07,884] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:219:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)
Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/users/1787/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.

Now, let's evaluate the given response against the ground truth.

Ground Truth:
```json
{
  "source": "Internal Referral",
  "fraud_type": "AP-Impersonation (Others)",
  "alerted_transactions": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-04",
      "amount": "HKD45,500",
      "from": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "333-333333-101",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "to": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "111-111111-101",
        "bank": "HASE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Given Response:
```json
{
  "source": "Internal Referral",
  "fraud_type": "AP-Impersonation (Others)",
  "alerted_transactions": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-04",
      "amount": "HKD45,500",
      "from": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "333-333333-101",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "to": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "111-111111-101",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "channel": "FPS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Evaluating the generated output against the correct output:

```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": false,
  "reason": "Extra field 'channel' found in generated output which is not present in the correct output.",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 1,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0
}
```

Explanation:
- The `channel` field is present in the generated output but not in the correct output, violating the completeness and accuracy criteria.
- Therefore, no transaction matches exactly, resulting in `number_of_transactions_correct` being 0. ```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": false,
  "reason": "Extra field 'channel' found in generated output which is not present in the correct output.",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 1,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 0
}

```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": true,
  "reason": "",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 2,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 2
}
``` To evaluate the provided JSON output against the specified criteria, we will compare it with the expected structure and content as outlined in the example evaluation. 

Given JSON output:
```json
{
  "source": "Internal Referral",
  "fraud_type": "AP-Impersonation (Others)",
  "alerted_transactions": [
    {
      "date": "2025-01-03",
      "amount": "HKD64,348",
      "from": {
        "name": "XIE PANGAN",
        "account_number": "666-666666666",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "to": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "024-0000000000",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "channel": "FPS"
    },
    {
      "date": "2025-01-03",
      "amount": "HKD32,300",
      "from": {
        "name": "XIE PANGAN",
        "account_number": "666-666666666",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "to": {
        "name": "CHAN TAI MAN",
        "account_number": "024-0000000000",
        "bank": "HASE"
      },
      "channel": "FPS"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Criteria Evaluation:**

1. **Completeness**: All required fields (`source`, `fraud_type`, `alerted_transactions`) are present.
2. **Accuracy**: The values appear to be accurate based on the provided data.
3. **Normalization**: Banks are correctly normalized to "HASE".
4. **Transaction Integrity**: Each transaction includes `date`, `amount`, `from`, and `to`.
5. **Source**: The `source` field is set to "Internal Referral".
6. **Fraud Type and Alerted Transactions**: Both fields are present.

Since there is no specific `correct_output` provided for comparison, I assume the provided JSON is correct based on the criteria.

**Evaluation Output:**
```json
{
  "is_satisfactory": true,
  "reason": "",
  "number_of_transactions_total": 2,
  "number_of_transactions_correct": 2
}
``` 

This indicates that the JSON output meets all the specified criteria. If you have a specific `correct_output` for comparison, please provide it for a more detailed evaluation. Otherwise, the output appears satisfactory based on the given criteria.'
