[2025-05-28 13:58:22,776] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:219:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)
Warning: The cache directory for DeepSpeed Triton autotune, /home/users/1787/.triton/autotune, appears to be on an NFS system. While this is generally acceptable, if you experience slowdowns or hanging when DeepSpeed exits, it is recommended to set the TRITON_CACHE_DIR environment variable to a non-NFS path.
