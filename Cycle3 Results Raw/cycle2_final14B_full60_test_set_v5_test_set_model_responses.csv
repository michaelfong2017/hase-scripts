ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transaction from the provided documents.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a match in the CSV file for the above transaction details.

#### Searching for Exact Match:
- **Exact Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Exact Amount:** 1.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

The CSV contains a matching transaction:

| Transaction Date | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the extracted and matched data, we merge the fields:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI (source) -> MISS YEUNG KAI (CSV)
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (source) -> HSBC (rule)
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN (source) -> Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS (CSV)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (source) -> HASE (rule)
- **Transaction References:** [b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE
- **Channel Rule:**
  - `CWTF` → `Branch`

### Step 5: Build Final JSON
Finally, we build the JSON output based on the extracted and matched data:

```json

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's go through the steps to process the provided documents.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction:

| Date       | Amount | Currency | Originator Name | Originator Account Number | Originator Bank | Beneficiary Name | Beneficiary Account Number | Beneficiary Bank |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match based on date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary name/account number. 

The transaction details from the CSV that matches the extracted transaction are:

| Date       | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data as per the schema.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rule:**
  - `CWTF` -> ""FPS""

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the fraud alert source to the CSV records, and then build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transactions:

| Date       | Amount   | Currency |
|------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-11-12 | 50000.00 | HKD      |
| 2024-11-12 | 56000.00 | HKD      |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2024-11-12, HKD50,000.00
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with Transaction ID `191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab`

#### Transaction 2: 2024-11-12, HKD56,000.00
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with Transaction ID `bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data for each transaction.

#### Merged Data for Transaction 1

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 50000.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Bank**: HSBC
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab]

#### Merged Data for Transaction 2

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 56000.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Bank**: HSBC
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No additional rules need to be applied as the data already fits within the defined rules.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transactions from the fraud alert source:

| Date       | Amount   | Currency | Originator Name          | Originator Account Number | Originator Bank                                                                                           | Beneficiary Name | Beneficiary Account Number | Beneficiary Bank |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 93000.00 | HKD      | MR CHAN TAI MAN          | 333-333333-101            | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited                                                       | CHAN TAI MAN     | 111-111111-101             | Hang Seng Bank Ltd.         |
| 2025-03-14 | 90000.00 | HKD      | MR CHAN TAI MAN          | 962-966666-101            | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited                                                       | CHAN TAI MAN     | 572-301740-327             | Hang Seng Bank Ltd.         |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### For the first transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 93000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

This matches the transaction with `Transaction ID` `d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7`.

#### For the second transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **Amount:** 90000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 962-966666-101
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 572-301740-327
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

This matches the transaction with `Transaction ID` `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For the first transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 93000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- **To:**
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Transaction References:** [d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7]

For the second transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-03-14
- **Amount:** 90000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 962-966666-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- **To:**
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 572-301740-327
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Transaction References:** [1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

All transactions already conform to the defined rules.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided documents.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 16500.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV records for the extracted transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 16500.00
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN

The matching transaction in the CSV is:

- **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 16500.00
- **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID**: 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Global Field (fraud_type)**: AP-Impersonation (Other)
- **Transaction References**: [98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rules**:
  - Since the transaction type source is CWTF, the channel is ""FPS"".

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

We need to find an exact match for the transaction extracted in Step 1:

- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** 10000
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Searching through the CSV, we find an exact match:

| Transaction Date | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw       | Originator Bank Raw                     | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address                                          | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |
|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 2024-08-25       | HKD                  | 10000              | C                      | Hang Seng Bank Ltd.        | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | 444-4444444-101         | 111-111111-101             | CHEUNG TAK SHING | CHAN TAI MAN    | Beneficiary | CWTF                     | Default transaction           |                                | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited            | 10000           | 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741 |

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** 10000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI (from source)
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601 (from source)
  - **Bank:** HSBC (from source)
- **Beneficiary:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN (from source)
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101 (from source)
  - **Bank:** HASE (from source)
- **Channel:** FPS (from Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - `CWTF` -> FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the data into the required JSON format:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": null,
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-25"",

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions and then build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: HKD25,900.00
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101

- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match based on the date, amount, originator account, and beneficiary account.

#### Exact Match Found:
- **CSV Record Matching Criteria**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Originating Currency**: HKD
  - **Originating Amount**: 25900
  - **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

The matching CSV record:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 25900
- **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Subject Type**: Beneficiary
- **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number**: 
- **Sending Bank Address**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Converted Amount**: 25900
- **Transaction ID**: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the extracted and matched data, we merge it into the required format.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:
- **from.bank**: HSBC
- **to.bank**: HASE
- **channel**: FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we build the JSON output based on the merged and adjusted data:

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we find the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** NA CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching the Transaction
- **Exact Match Criteria:** Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- **Candidate CSV Record:** 
  - **Date:** 2024-08-28
  - **Amount:** 50000
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR    CHUNG SIU
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102

This record matches the date and amount exactly. We also have the beneficiary name and account number matching the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We now merge the data from the fraud alert source and the CSV record.

#### Merged Data
- **Date:** 2024-08-28
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Currency:** HKD (inferred from the CSV record)
- **From:**
  - **Name:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
  - **Account_Number:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
  - **Bank:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR    CHUNG SIU
  - **Account_Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** HASE (as per the rule)

Police Letter,9,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions, and then produce the consolidated JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Cash Deposit

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find an exact match in the CSV for the transaction extracted above.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Bank:** Cash Deposit (This is a special case as the originator bank is ""Cash Deposit"")

The transaction in the CSV matches the date, amount, and beneficiary account number.

#### Exact Match Found:
- **Transaction ID:** bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will now merge the data from the CSV with the details from the fraud alert source.

#### Merging Details:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** null (since it's a cash deposit)
  - **Account Number:** null (since it's a cash deposit)
  - **Bank:** null (since it's a cash deposit)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash
- **Transaction References:** [bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1]
- **Can Be Located:** true

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Since the originator bank is ""Cash Deposit,"" we apply the Cash Transaction Rules:
- **Channel:** cash
- **From.Bank:** null
- **From.Name:** null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
Extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:
- **Fraud Type:** Romance Scam
- **Police Reference:** Policeref1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
Extract all transactions with both date and amount:

1. **First Table:**
   - Date: `2024-05-22`
   - Amount: `3000`
   - Originator Bank: `Hang Seng Bank`
   - Originator Account: `222-222222-101`
   - Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
   - Beneficiary Account: `111-111111-101`

2. **Second Table:**
   - Date: `2024-05-22`
   - Amount: `50000`
   - Originator Bank: `Cash Deposit`
   - Originator Account: `Cash Deposit`
   - Beneficiary Name: `CHIU YAN`
   - Beneficiary Account: `111-111111-103`

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Match each transaction from the fraud alert source to the CSV records:

1. **First Table:**
   - **Exact Match:** Found in CSV with Transaction ID `7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a`
     - **Date:** `2024-05-22`
     - **Amount:** `3000`
     - **Originator Bank:** `Hang Seng Bank`
     - **Originator Account:** `222-222222-101`
     - **Beneficiary Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`

     - **Originator Account:** `Cash Deposit`
     - **Beneficiary Name:** `CHIU YAN`
     - **Beneficiary Account:** `111-111111-103`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Merge the data from the CSV records with the fraud alert source data:

1. **First Table:**
   - **Transaction ID:** `7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a`
   - **Date:** `2024-05-22`

     - **Account Number:** `111-111111-103`
     - **Bank:** `HASE`
   - **Channel:** `cash`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Apply the transaction rules:

1. **First Table:**
   - **Channel:** `ATM` (based on `ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT`)
   - **From.Bank:** `Hang Seng Bank` (directly mentioned in the source)
   - **To.Bank:** `HASE`

2. **Second Table:**
   - **Channel:** `cash` (due to ""Cash Deposit"")
   - **From.Bank:** `null` (as per cash rule)
   - **From.Name:** `null` (as per cash rule)
   - **To.Bank:** `HASE`

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
Apply the global field rules:

- **Fraud Type:** `Telephone Deception`
- **Police Reference:** `Policeref1`
- **Police Team:** `District Investigation Team 4, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station`

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Construct the final JSON output:

- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps to process the given documents.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Originator Bank:** CASH
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Exact Match:** Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Checking the CSV records:

- Record 1:
  - Date: 2024-07-17
  - Amount: 30000
  - This does not match the extracted transaction.

- Record 2:
  - Date: 2024-07-17
  - Amount: 9000
  - This matches the extracted transaction.

- Record 3:
  - Date: 2024-07-15
  - Amount: 40000
  - This does not match the extracted transaction.

So, the transaction with `Transaction ID: 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f` is the best match.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Bank:** CASH
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction Type Source:** CCCS
- **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Channel:** ""cash"" (based on the transaction code description)
- **from.bank:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **from.name:** null (since it's a cash transaction)
- **to.bank:** ""HASE""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** Telephone Deception
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,12,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions from the given fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2024-07-15 | 40000  | CASH CASH                     |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to match the transaction `2024-07-15` with `40000` to the CSV records.

#### Matching the Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Matching against the CSV records:
- The exact match is found in the third row:
  - **Date:** 2024-07-15
  - **Amount:** 40000
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
  - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)
  - **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM (since the source mentions ""CASH CASH"")

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We now merge the data from the CSV record with the extracted transaction details.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Applying the cash transaction rules:
- Since the originator bank/account is ""CASH CASH"", we set:
  - **channel:** cash deposits via ATM
  - **from.bank:** null
  - **from.name:** null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
Extract global fields from the source document:
- **Fraud Type:** Employment Fraud
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF2
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Construct the final JSON output according to the schema:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Employment Fraud"",
  ""police_reference"": ""POLICEREF2"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station"",

- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
There are no specific transactions mentioned in the provided fraud alert source document with both date and amount. Therefore, we cannot proceed to extract any transactions.

Since there are no transactions to extract, we can conclude our processing here. However, we will still extract the global fields as required.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we do not need to perform any matching.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, there are no transactions to merge.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
No transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
Let's extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception
- **Police Reference**: KTRN230■■■■
- **Writ No.**: 8■■■
- **Contact Person**: PC 1■■■■
- **Police Team**: District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Since no transactions were extracted, the `alerted_transactions` array will be empty.

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's go through the steps to extract and match the transactions from the fraud alert source to the CSV records, and then consolidate the data into the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transactions from the fraud alert source:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-08-29
   - Amount: 20000
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-08-30
   - Amount: 20000
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** 20000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Matched CSV Record:
- **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
- **Originator Name:** TAI MAN CHAN
- **Beneficiary Name:**CHAN TAI MAN

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** 20000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102

Matched CSV Record:
- **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
- **Originator Name:** SIU CHUNG
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data for Transaction 1:
- **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
- **Date:** 2024-08-29
- **Amount:** 20000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** TAI MAN CHAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** ZA Bank Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM
- **can_be_located:** true
- **cancel_amount_requested:** null

#### Merged Data for Transaction 2:
- **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
- **Date:** 2024-08-30
- **Amount:** 20000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** SIU CHUNG
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** ZA Bank Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM
- **can_be_located:** true
- **cancel_amount_requested:** null

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- Since the fraud type is ""External Fraud"", we'll use ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"" as the fraud type.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules:**
- **From Bank:** ZA Bank Limited (based on the provided mappings)
- **To Bank:** HASE (as specified in the fraud alert source)

**Channel Rules:**
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

    }

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match the extracted transaction to the CSV record:

- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-07-10
  - **Originating Currency**: HKD
  - **Originating Amount**: 1
  - **Debit Credit Indicator**: (not needed for matching)
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
  - **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
  - **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Subject Type**: Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
  - **Sending Bank Account Number**: (not needed for matching)
  - **Sending Bank Address**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK
  - **Converted Amount**: 1
  - **Transaction ID**: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

Since the transaction details match exactly, we use the CSV transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV record with the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction References**: [b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d]
- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number**: 666-66666-601
  - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **To**:
  - **Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 1.00

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **To Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

UAR,5,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON represents the processed and merged information from the fraud alert source and the transaction records CSV.",4528.0,774.0
UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extract the transaction information from the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** Not explicitly mentioned, so we cannot use it.
- **Amount:** HKD 130000
- **Currency:** HKD

Since the date is not explicitly mentioned, we will skip this transaction as it does not meet the requirement of having both date and amount.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since there is no valid transaction from the fraud alert source due to missing date information, we cannot proceed to matching.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

There are no transactions to merge.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

Since there are no transactions to process, we'll still extract the global fields:

- **fraud_type:** External Fraud

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

There are no transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given that there are no valid transactions to process, the final JSON will reflect the global field and an empty list for transactions.

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV record, and applies the necessary rules and mappings as specified.",2767.0,868.0
UAR,25,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transaction from the given fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: 25900.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 17833.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV record:

- **CSV Record**:
  - **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Originating Currency**: HKD
  - **Originating Amount**: 25900.00
  - **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
  - **Originator Bank Raw**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Subject Type**: Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source**: CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description**: Default transaction
  - **Sending Bank Account Number**: 
  - **Sending Bank Address**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Converted Amount**: 25900.00
  - **Transaction ID**: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

The extracted transaction matches the CSV record exactly based on the date and amount, and the originator and beneficiary account names and numbers.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We merge the data from the CSV record into the extracted transaction:

- **Global Fields**:
  - **Fraud Type**: External Fraud

- **Transaction Fields**:
  - **Date**: 2024-11-08
  - **Amount**: 25900.00
  - **Currency**: HKD
  - **Originator**:

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:

- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 30000.00
- **Currency:** HKD

Extracted Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",
  ""amount"": 30000.00,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101""
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM""
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We now need to find an exact match in the CSV records based on the extracted transaction details.

- **Exact Match Criteria:**
  - Date: 2024-07-17
  - Amount: 30000.00
  - Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
  - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

Matching CSV Record:
```csv
2024-07-17,HKD,30000,C,,,222-222222-101,111-111111-101,CHEUNG TAK SHING,CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT,,,30000,2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
```

This record matches our extracted transaction perfectly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will now merge the data from the CSV record into our extracted transaction.

- **CSV Values:**
  - Transaction ID: `2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4`
  - Date: `2024-07-17`
  - Amount: `30000`
  - Currency: `HKD`
  - Originator Name: `CHEUNG TAK SHING`
  - Originator Account Number: `222-222222-101`
  - Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
  - Beneficiary Account Number: `111-111111-101`
  - Channel: `ATM`

Merged Transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",
  ""amount"": 30000.00,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4""]
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type Rules:**
  - Fraud Type: `AP-Impersonation (Others)`
  - Since it is ""Others"", we look for other fraud type hints. There are no specific hints in the document, so we use ""Not provided"".

Global Field:
```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided""
}
```

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules:**
  - from.bank: `HASE`
  - to.bank: `HASE`

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Based on Transaction Code Description: `ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT` → `ATM`

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV records.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions reported:
1. **First Transaction:**
   - Date: 2024-12-10
   - Amount: HKD46,000.00

2. **Second Transaction:**
   - Date: 2024-12-11
   - Amount: HKD46,000.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find exact matches in the CSV records based on date and amount.

#### First Transaction:
- Date: 2024-12-10
- Amount: HKD46,000.00
- Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 333-333333-102

This transaction matches the first row in the CSV.

#### Second Transaction:
- Date: 2024-12-11
- Amount: HKD46,000.00
- Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

This transaction matches the second row in the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will merge the data from the CSV records into the extracted transactions.

#### First Matched Transaction:
- CSV Record: `6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`
- Date: 2024-12-10
- Amount: 46000
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: MR CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - Account Number: 222-222222-101
  - Bank: HASE
- To:
  - Name: (Not Provided)
  - Account Number: 333-333333-102
  - Bank: (Determined from CSV)
- Channel: ATM

#### Second Matched Transaction:
- CSV Record: `dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`
- Date: 2024-12-11
- Amount: 46000
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: MR CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - Account Number: 222-222222-101
  - Bank: HASE
- To:
  - Name: CHAN, TAIMAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: (Determined from CSV)
- Channel: ATM

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** MO is ""Impersonation"". Since it's not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we use ""Impersonation"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- For both transactions, the bank codes are consistent with HASE as specified.
- The channels are determined from the Transaction Code Descriptions.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

ADCC,307,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 433/2824 and WTSDIST 21819600 (DIT 0 1338908) (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 8281/1053 and e-Hub 48932528 (DIT 4-80957) (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-10-07
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Amount:** 117784.54
- **Originator Account Number:** 43039117182
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 662-273148-371
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK
- **Beneficiary Name:** HUNG CHI HO

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to match this transaction to the CSV record provided.

- **CSV Record:**
  - **Transaction Date:** 2023-10-27
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 117784.54

HSBC Referral,1803,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-05-14
- **Amount:** 1.41
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** HOI LAAM
- **Originator Account Number:** 910-53021-516
- **Originator Bank:** Chong Hing Bank Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** TAK SHING MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 881-946769-831
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Public Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Transaction Reference:** HC12■■■■■■

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to match the above transaction details to the CSV record.

- **CSV Record:**
  - **Transaction Date:** 2024-05-14
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 1.41
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Public Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
  - **Originator Bank Raw:** Chong Hing Bank Limited
  - **Originator Account Number:** 910-53021-516
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 881-946769-831
  - **Originator Name:** AU HOI LAAM
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING MAN AND OTHERS
  - **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

Since the originator name in the fraud alert source is ""HOI LAAM"" and in the CSV it is ""AU HOI LAAM"", and the beneficiary name in the fraud alert source is ""TAK SHING MAN"" and in the CSV it is ""CHEUNG TAK SHING MAN AND OTHERS"", there is a partial match based on the account numbers and the date/amount. However, the names do not fully match, so we will use the closest match available.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record and the fraud alert source, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-05-14
- **Amount:** 1.41
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** AU HOI LAAM
- **Originator Account Number:** 910-53021-516
- **Originator Bank:** Chong Hing Bank Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING MAN AND OTHERS
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 881-946769-831
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Public Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Transaction Reference:** HC12■■■■■■
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
- **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - `CWTF` → ""FPS""

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2025-05-08
- **Amount:** 13156.62
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 552-410909-941
- **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Bank:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** YIP MING WAH MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV for the above transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-05-08
- **Amount:** 13156.62
- **Originator Account Number:** 552-410909-941
- **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 615-987804-432
- **Beneficiary Name:** YIP MING WAH MAN

Matching the extracted transaction to the CSV records:
- The exact match is found in the first row of the CSV:
  - **Transaction Date:** 2025-05-08
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 13156.62
  - **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited
  - **Originator Bank Raw:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited
  - **Originator Account Number:** 552-410909-941
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 615-987804-432
  - **Originator Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** YIP MING WAH MAN
  - **Subject Type:** Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
  - **Converted Amount:** 25500
  - **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data as follows:
- **Global Field (fraud_type):** AP- Impersonation(others)
- **Date:** 2025-05-08
- **Amount:** 13156.62
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Account Number:** 552-410909-941
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** YIP MING WAH MAN
  - **Account Number:** 615-987804-432
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules:
- **Bank Rules:**
  - From Bank: HSBC
  - To Bank: HASE
- **Channel Rule:**
  - Transaction Type Source: CWTF → FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

The final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""AP- Impersonation(others)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

HSBC Referral,1805,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find an exact match based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account numbers, and names.

#### Transaction 1:
- **Exact Match Found:**
  - **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

#### Transaction 2:
- **Exact Match Found:**
  - **Transaction ID:** 191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

HSBC Referral,1805,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

BANK:HASE --> Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transaction data.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2025-05-28
- **Amount:** 8479.58
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 288-811572-507
- **Originator Name:** KWOK HOI KWAN
- **Originator Bank:** Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 948-181193-162
- **Beneficiary Name:** MEI FONG MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV records based on the date, amount, originator account/bank, and beneficiary account/bank.

After reviewing the CSV data, the matching record is:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 8479.58
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited
- **Originator Bank:** Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR        CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
- **Converted Amount:** 16500

Since there is no exact match based on the exact account numbers, we conclude that the transaction cannot be located precisely.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there is no exact match, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No adjustments needed since there is no exact match.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

HSBC Referral,1807,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2025-03-07
- **Amount:** HKD10505.47
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 770-31637-050
- **Originator Name:** CHEN WEI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 697-307916-313
- **Beneficiary Name:** POON SIU FONG
- **Beneficiary Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match based on the date, amount, originator/beneficiary account numbers, and names.

Checking the CSV records:

- The closest match is the second row with the following details:
  - **Transaction Date:** 2025-03-07
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 10000
  - **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
  - **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction ID:** 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741
  - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
  - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

Since there is no exact match (the amounts differ), we conclude that this transaction cannot be located in the CSV records.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there is no exact match, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No specific rules apply here since the transaction could not be matched.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2024-05-14
- **Amount:** 35472.03
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** TONG SIU WAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 873-211452-646
- **Originator Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 846-934471-779
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the date and amount.

The CSV contains a single transaction:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-05-14
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 35472.03
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 873-211452-646
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 846-934471-779
- **Originator Name:** SIU WAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

This transaction matches the extracted details from the fraud alert source. Therefore, we use the transaction ID `c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- **Date:** 2024-05-14
- **Amount:** 35472.03
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** SIU WAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 873-211452-646
  - **Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 846-934471-779
  - **Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Transaction References:** [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **From Bank:** Adjusted to ""HSBC""
- **To Bank:** Adjusted to ""HASE""
- **Channel:** Based on the transaction code description ""Default transaction"" and transaction source ""CWTF"", the channel is set to ""Branch"".

### Step 5: Build Final JSON
Here is the final JSON output:

Police Letter,2552,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

BANK:HASE --> DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2025-08-18
- **Amount:** 74258.80
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** NA CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to match the transaction from the source to the CSV records. We'll look for an exact match on date, amount, and check if the originator or beneficiary details match.

#### Matching the Transaction
- **Source Transaction:**
  - Date: 2025-08-18
  - Amount: 74258.80
  - Transferor's Bank and Account: NA CASH

- **CSV Record:**
  - **Transaction ID:** 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
  - **Transaction Date (value):** 2025-08-18
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 50000.0
  - **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
  - **Originator Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
  - **Originator Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 412-574078-616
  - **Originator Name:** MR    CHUNG SIU
  - **Beneficiary Name:** WAI MING
  - **Transaction Type Source:** CCCS
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

Since the originator's bank and account are marked as ""NA CASH"" in the source, we will consider this as a cash transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will now merge the data from the source and the CSV record.

#### Merged Data
- **Date:** 2025-08-18
- **Amount:** 74258.80
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR    CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **To:**
  - **Name:** WAI MING
  - **Account Number:** 412-574078-616
  - **Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Channel:** cash
- **can_be_located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- Since the originator's bank and account are marked as ""NA CASH,"" we set:
  - **channel:** cash
  - **from.bank:** null
  - **from.name:** null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** Investment Scam
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 7645/3511 and ERC223931770223
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the extracted and matched data, the final JSON output is:

```json

- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2025-06-30
- **Amount:** 74247.46

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Next, we match this transaction to the CSV records:

- **CSV Record:**
  - **Transaction Date:** 2025-06-30
  - **Originating Currency:** HKD
  - **Originating Amount:** 74247.46
  - **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
  - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** HASE
  - **Originator Bank Raw:** Bank of East Asia, Limited
  - **Originator Account Number:** 
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 994-535790-316
  - **Originator Name:** 
  - **Beneficiary Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Subject Type:** Beneficiary
  - **Transaction Type Source:** CCAS
  - **Transaction Code Description:** CIF CASH DEPOSIT
  - **Sending Bank Account Number:** 
  - **Sending Bank Address:** 
  - **Converted Amount:** 50000
  - **Transaction ID:** bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1

Since there is an exact match (same date and amount), we use the Transaction ID `bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Now, we merge the data from the fraud alert source and the CSV record:

- **Global Fields:**
  - **Fraud Type:** Romance Scam
  - **Police Reference:** ESPS 201/1048 and TYDIV 6633401
  - **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

- **Transaction Fields:**
  - **Date:** 2025-06-30
  - **Amount:** 74247.46
  - **Currency:** HKD
  - **From:**
    - **Name:** 
    - **Account Number:** 
    - **Bank:** Bank of East Asia, Limited
  - **To:**
    - **Name:** TSANG MEI LIN
    - **Account Number:** 994-535790-316
    - **Bank:** HASE
  - **Channel:** cash
  - **Can Be Located:** true
  - **Transaction References:** [bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1]

### Step 4: Apply Cash Transaction Rules

Since the originator bank/raw mentions ""Cash Deposit,"" we apply the cash transaction rules:

- **Channel:** cash
- **From.Bank:** null
- **From.Name:** null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

The global fields have already been extracted and applied correctly.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

Police Letter,2560,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

BANK:HASE --> DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited","Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 29109.40
- **Originator Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 883-952441-182
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 644-853499-406
- **Beneficiary Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file for the extracted transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-10-31
- **Amount:** 25500.0
- **Originator Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 883-952441-182
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 644-853499-406
- **Beneficiary Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG
- **Originator Name:** MA CHI KEUNG

Since there is an exact match for the date and amount, we will use the transaction ID `82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

Then use CSV values for all transaction fields:
- **Date:** 2024-10-31
- **Amount:** 29109.40
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MA CHI KEUNG
  - **Account Number:** 883-952441-182
  - **Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG
  - **Account Number:** 644-853499-406
  - **Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Channel:** ATM
- **Can Be Located:** true

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** ATM (based on the transaction code description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Telephone Deception
- **Police Reference:** TM 440
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2562,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2562,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

BANK:HASE --> Hang Seng Bank Ltd.","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have one transaction reported with both date and amount:

| Date       | Amount     |
|------------|------------|
| 2024-11-02 | 32643.38   |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find an exact match for the transaction with the date `2024-11-02` and amount `32643.38`.

- **CSV Record Matching the Criteria:**
  - Date: `2024-11-02`
  - Amount: `40000.00`
  - Originator Account Number: `111-111111-101`
  - Beneficiary Account Number: `367-486488-766`
  - Originator Name: Not specified
  - Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
  - Transaction ID: `798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106`

Since there is an exact match for the date and amount, we use the Transaction ID from the CSV record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
- **Transaction References:** `[798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]`
- **From Fields:**
  - Name: Not specified (replaced with null)
  - Account Number: `111-111111-101`
  - Bank: Based on the source, it's ""CASH CASH"", so set channel to ""cash"" and bank to null.
- **To Fields:**
  - Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
  - Account Number: `367-486488-766`
  - Bank: ""HASE""
- **Date:** `2024-11-02`
- **Amount:** `40000.00`
- **Currency:** `HKD`
- **Channel:** `cash`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- Since the transaction involves cash, the channel is set to ""cash"".
- The originator bank is set to null due to the cash transaction.
- The beneficiary bank is set to ""HASE"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type:** Employment Fraud
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 53/4347
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available

   - Since there are no transactions in the CSV file, the `alerted_transactions` array is empty.",2115.0,304.0
Search Warrant,3307,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
There are no specific transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount. Therefore, there are no transactions to extract for further processing.

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we do not need to proceed with Steps 2, 3, and 4.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
Extract the relevant global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception
- **Police Reference**: ESPS  3644/4011 and WTSDIST 99514370

- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""

    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, we have two transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 29-August-2024
   - Amount: 26255.13 HKD
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 269-747318-156

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 30-August-2024
   - Amount: 26136.31 HKD
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 925-199224-571

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-09-25
- **Amount:** 26255.13 HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 269-747318-156

Exact match found in the CSV file:
- **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 26136.31 HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 925-199224-571

Exact match found in the CSV file:
- **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data for Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-09-25
- **Amount:** 26255.13
- **Currency:** HKD
- **from:**
  - **Name:** TSANG MEI LIN MAN
  - **Account Number:** 269-747318-156
  - **Bank:** CCBA
- **to:**
  - **Name:** POON FONG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 925-199224-571
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM
- **can_be_located:** true
- **cancel_amount_requested:** null
- **Transaction References:** [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]

#### Merged Data for Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 26136.31
- **Currency:** HKD
- **from:**
  - **Name:** TSANG MEI LIN MAN
  - **Account Number:** 316-335060-288
  - **Bank:** CCBA
- **to:**
  - **Name:** POON FONG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 518-269012-766
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM
- **can_be_located:** true
- **cancel_amount_requested:** null
- **Transaction References:** [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:**
  - From the source: External Fraud (Payments(Authorised/Scams))
  - Since it's ""External Fraud"", we'll use ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"" as the fraud type.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - Originator Bank: CCBA (as per the mapping rule)
  - Beneficiary Bank: HASE (as per the mapping rule)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Channel: cash deposits via ATM

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4305,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:

- **Date:** 2025-06-28
- **Amount:** 23344.94
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 615-405900-782
- **Originator Account Number:** 156-864477-641
- **Beneficiary Name:** KAN CHI WING MAN
- **Originator Name:** WONG SIU MING

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file for the extracted transaction:

- **Date:** 2025-06-28
- **Amount:** 23344.94
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 615-405900-782
- **Originator Account Number:** 156-864477-641
- **Beneficiary Name:** KAN CHI WING MAN
- **Originator Name:** WONG SIU MING

Matching the details, we find the exact match in the CSV:

```csv
2025-06-28,HKD,23344.94,C,China CITIC Bank International Limited,Chong Hing Bank Limited,156-864477-641,615-405900-782,WONG SIU MING,KAN        CHI WING MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Chong Hing Bank Limited    HK,25500,1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
```

The matched transaction ID is `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`
- **Date:** 2025-06-28
- **Amount:** 23344.94
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name:** KAN CHI WING MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 156-864477-641
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 615-405900-782
- **Originator Bank:** Chong Hing Bank Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Channel:** CWTF → FPS

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** Chong Hing Bank Limited
  - **to.bank:** CCBA

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** FPS

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** 25381.00

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extracting the transaction from the fraud alert source:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 8723.67
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** TSE KA LEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** SIU WAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 786-417904-259
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 289-990790-575
- **Channel:** FPS (based on ""FPS REF NO."")

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Search for the exact match:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 8723.67
- Originator Account: 786-417904-259
- Beneficiary Account: 289-990790-575

The exact match is found in the CSV record:
- **Transaction ID:** c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record:
- **Transaction ID:** c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432
- **Originator Name:** TSE KA LEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** SIU WAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 786-417904-259
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 289-990790-575
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 8723.67
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Channel:** FPS

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type:**
- From the source: External Fraud
- No additional hints found, so use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules:**
- **from.bank:** DBS (based on the extracted bank code)
- **to.bank:** HASE (based on the extracted bank code)

**Channel Rules:**
- **Channel:** FPS (already determined from the source)

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 20000.00 (as specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

}",86,1,1,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and match the transactions from the given fraud alert source and CSV records, then produce the consolidated JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Extracted transaction from the fraud alert source:
- **Date:** Not explicitly provided (will use null)
- **Amount:** 130000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** 張先生 (Zhang Xiao Shi)
- **Beneficiary Name:** 台manent (CHAN TAI MAN)
- **Originator Account Number:** Not provided
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** Not provided

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since the exact date is not provided, we cannot perform an exact match. However, we can still check if the amount matches any transaction in the CSV.

Given CSV transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-10-07
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 192500
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 66666666601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

There is no exact match due to the missing date and originator/beneficiary account numbers in the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there is no exact match, we will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as provided in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since there is no exact match, we will use the source-provided values for the transaction fields.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output based on the provided data:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 21-Aug-2024
- **Amount**: 1236.16
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Originator Account Number**: 188-732294-315
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 233-842379-517

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a match in the CSV file for the extracted transaction:
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Amount**: 1236.16
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Originator Account Number**: 188-732294-315
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 233-842379-517

The CSV file contains a single transaction that matches the extracted transaction details:
- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the matched CSV transaction, we extract the required fields:
- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Amount**: 1236.16
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Originator Account Number**: 188-732294-315
- **Originator Bank**: CCBA (from the provided mapping)
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 233-842379-517
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: ATM

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**:
  - Originator Bank: CCBA
  - Beneficiary Bank: HASE
- **Channel Rule**: ATM

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Consolidating all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

UAR,4325,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ODFT,5062,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date**: 2024-02-09
- **Amount**: 20149.98
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG
- **Originator Account Number**: 807-510611-957

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We now need to match this transaction to the CSV records. We will look for an exact match based on the date, amount, and account numbers.

#### Matching Process:
- **CSV Record 1**:
  - **Date**: 2024-02-09
  - **Amount**: 20149.98
  - **Originator Account Number**: 807-511061-957
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 945-202486-777
  - **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
  - **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG

This record matches the extracted transaction details.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the matched CSV record, we will merge the data and fill in the necessary fields.

- **Transaction ID**: 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
- **Date**: 2024-02-09
- **Amount**: 20149.98
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
- **Originator Account Number**: 807-511061-957
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 945-202486-777
- **Originator Bank**: HASE
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: ATM

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: AP-Impersonation (Others)

Since the fraud type is ""Others"", we will use the hint provided in the document which is ""Impersonation"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**: 
  - Originator Bank: HASE
  - Beneficiary Bank: HASE
- **Channel Rules**: 
  - Based on the description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we extract the transactions:
- **Date:** 2024-12-12
- **Amounts:** HKD58522.91, HKD34277.84
- **Originator Account:** 413-792162-294
- **Customer Name:** SIT MING MING MING

We have two amounts, so we'll create two transactions:
1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-12-12
   - Amount: 58522.91
   - Currency: HKD
   - Originator Account: 413-792162-294
   - Originator Name: SIT MING MING MING

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-12-12
   - Amount: 34277.84
   - Currency: HKD
   - Originator Account: 413-792162-294

- **Amount:** 34277.84
- **Originator Account:** 473-322997-675
- **Originator Name:** SIU MING MING

This matches exactly with the second row in the CSV file:
- **Transaction ID:** dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
