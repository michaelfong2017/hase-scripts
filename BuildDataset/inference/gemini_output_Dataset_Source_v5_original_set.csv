ADCC,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Fraud"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""DIT2-■■■■■, Hong Kong Police Force"" - Extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   The code iterates through each transaction listed in the fraud alert source.
    *   For each transaction, it attempts to find a matching record in the transaction CSV based on the matching rules.
    *   **Matching Rules:**
        *   **Date and Amount:** The date and amount from the fraud alert must exactly match the ""Transaction Date"" and ""Originating Amount"" columns in the CSV, respectively.
        *   **Account Number or Name:** Either the originator or beneficiary account number or name must match between the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   **can\_be\_located Logic:**
        *   If a match is found in the CSV, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   If no match is found, `can_be_located` is set to `false`.
    *   **Data Merging:**
        *   If `can_be_located` is `true`, the transaction data is merged from both the fraud alert and the CSV, with the CSV data taking precedence.
        *   If `can_be_located` is `false`, the transaction data is taken solely from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Example:**
        *   The transaction with Date ""2024-08-24"" and Amount ""50000"" HKD, Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" is found in the CSV. Therefore, `can_be_located` is `true`, and the data is merged, with the CSV values overriding the fraud alert values where applicable.
        *   The transaction with Date ""2"
ADCC,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a ""Social Media Deception"" case.
    *   The police reference is ""ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■"".
    *   The police team is ""E-HUB-■■■"" with geographic location ""Hong Kong Police Force"".
    *   One transaction is identified with a date of ""2024-10-07"" and an amount of ""192500 HKD"". The originating bank is ""BOC"", the originating account number is ""66666666601"", and the originating name is ""YEUNG KAI"". The beneficiary bank is ""HSB"", the beneficiary account number is ""111-111111-101"", and the beneficiary name is ""CHAN TAI MAN"".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains one transaction record with a date of ""2024-10-07"", an amount of ""192500"", originating currency ""HKD"", originating account number ""66666666601"", beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"", originator name ""YEUNG KAI"", and beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"".

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the CSV record because:
        *   The date ""2024-10-07"" matches exactly.
        *   The amount ""192500"" matches exactly.
        *   The originator account number ""66666666601"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" matches.
        *   The originator name ""YEUNG KAI"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` are populated using the CSV data where available.
        *   `channel` is set to `null` as it is not available in either source.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the global fields and the merged transaction data, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with `null` values used where data is unavailable.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Investment (Online Gambling Website)"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""ESPS  ■■■■/2024 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""DIT 5-■■■■■■■"".

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2024-07-25
        *   Amount: 135524
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source matches the third row in the transaction CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-07-25) and amount (135524) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (66666666602) matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Name (TSANG SIU MING) matches the from.name in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the to.name in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  Data Merging:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV: ""2024-07-25"".
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV: 135524.0.
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV: ""HKD"".
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV: ""TSANG SIU MING"".
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV: ""66666666602"".
        *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"".
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"".
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV: ""111-111111-101"".
        *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."".
        *   `channel`: No value in CSV, so set to `null`.

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched and merged transaction.
"
ADCC,16,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a ""Social Media Deception - Romance Scam"" investigated by ""DIT 7-■■■■■■■"".
    *   The police reference is ""ESPS ■■■■/2024 and WCHDIV ■■■■■■■■"".
    *   One transaction is listed with a date of ""2024-09-30"" and an amount of ""198500 HKD"". The remitting bank is ""CCBA"", depositor account number is ""66666666601"", and depositor name is ""YEUNG KAI"". The beneficiary account number is ""111-111111-101"" and beneficiary name is ""CHAN TAI MAN"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-09-30"" and amount ""198500"" is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the CSV row because:
        *   The date ""2024-09-30"" matches exactly.
        *   The amount ""198500"" matches exactly.
        *   The originator account number ""66666666601"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" matches.
        *   The originator name ""YEUNG KAI"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken directly from the fraud alert source. The police team also includes the geographic location ""Hong Kong Police Force"".
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` are populated using the CSV data where available. The CSV data is prioritized.
        *   `channel` is set to `null` because it is not present in either the fraud alert source or the CSV.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.

            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Telephone Deception""** reported on **2024-12-10** and it is under the investigation by **DIT3-■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim/ from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
iii) The details of next layer beneficiary account(s) relating to the below transaction of [AC2] (including details of transaction, bank, account number and beneficiary name). If the beneficiary account(s) belong to your bank, please provide us the account balance.

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 1■■■■■■ and TMDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT3-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""ESPS 1■■■■■■ and TMDIV 24■■■■■"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""DIT3-■■■■■ (Hong Kong Police Force)"" - Extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2024-12-03
        *   Amount: 145886
    *   Matching Logic:
        *   The transaction with Date ""2024-12-03"" and Amount ""145886"" was found in the CSV.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" from the fraud alert matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-102"" from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, the transaction was matched and `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  Data Merging:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: ""2024-12-03"" - Taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: 145886.0 - Taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" - Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: ""YEUNG KAI"" - Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: ""666-66666-601"" - Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: ""HSBC"" - Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.name`: ""CHUNG SIU"" - Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-102"" - Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.bank`: ""HSB"" - Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `channel`: null - No channel information was available in either source.

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
"
ADCC,23,12,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■■/2024 and TY RN ■■■■■■■ (DIT 4 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Telephone Deception - Pretend Customer Service"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""ESPS ■■■■■/2024"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""DIT 4 ■■■■■■■"". The location ""(Hong Kong)"" was added based on the source context.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2024-12-03
        *   Amount: 144123
    *   The transaction was located in the CSV because:
        *   The date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""144123"" matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-101"" from the CSV matched the from.account\_number in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV, the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV: ""2024-12-03"".
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV: 144123.0.
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV: ""HKD"".
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"".
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV: ""444-4444444-101"".
        *   `from.bank`: Set to null as no bank information was available in the CSV for the originator.
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV: ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV: ""111-111111-101"".
        *   `to.bank`: Taken from the fraud alert source: ""HSB"".
        *   `channel`: Taken from the CSV: ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"".

4.  **Adherence to Schema and Instructions:**
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the processed transaction.
    *   The date and amount are present and non-null for the transaction.
    *   Content is preserved exactly as found in the source documents, including whitespace.
    *   Leading/trailing whitespace has been trimmed where appropriate.
"
ADCC,28,1,"[1, 2, 3, 4]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Social Media Description - Pig-butchering Scam"".
    *   `police_reference`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""ESPS 7■■■■■■ and WCHDIV 25■■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""DIT7-■■■■■ (Hong Kong)"". The location ""Hong Kong"" was added based on the source document.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists several transactions across multiple beneficiaries. Each transaction includes a date and amount, which are essential for validation.
    *   For each transaction, the script attempts to find a matching record in the provided CSV file.
    *   The matching criteria are:
        *   `Date`: The date in the fraud alert must exactly match the ""Transaction Date (value)"" in the CSV.
        *   `Amount`: The amount in the fraud alert must exactly match the ""Originating Amount"" in the CSV.
        *   `Account Number or Name`: Either the originator or beneficiary account number or name must match between the fraud alert and the CSV.

3.  **Matching and Merging Logic:**
    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-30, 100000 HKD, CHAN, TAI MAN):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHAN, TAI MAN"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.
    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-30, 100000 HKD, CHUNG SIU):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHUNG SIU"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.
    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-12-31, 100000 HKD, CHUNG SIU):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHUNG SIU"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.
    *   **Transaction 4 (2024-12-31, 100000 HKD, CHIU YAN):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHIU YAN"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.
    *   **Transaction 5 (2024-12-30, 50000 HKD, CHONG MAN):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHONG MAN"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.
    *   **Transaction 6 (2024-12-30, 50000 HKD, CHONG MAN):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHONG MAN"" matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV, and the beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, with the CSV values taking priority.

4.  **Data Prioritization:**
    *   For transactions where `can"
ADCC,31,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Social Media Deception - Compensated Dating Decep"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""ESPS ■■■■/2025 and e-Hub ■■■■■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""DIT 5-■■■■■"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-02-04, HKD 110555):**
        *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing missing values (none in this case).

    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-02-04, HKD 50000):**
        *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing missing values (none in this case).

    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-02-05, HKD 200000, CCBA):**
        *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing missing values (none in this case).

    *   **Transaction 4 (2025-02-05, HKD 200000, DBS):**
        *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing missing values (none in this case).

3.  **Data Prioritization:**

    *   For all transactions where `can_be_located` is `true`, the CSV data is prioritized. If a field is missing in the CSV, the corresponding value from the fraud alert source is used. If a field is missing in both, it is set to `null`.

4.  **Output:**

    *   The output is a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All required fields are present, with missing values represented as `null`.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains all identified fraudulent transactions.

ADCC,35,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2025-01-27** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 3 ■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and TSTDIV ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 3 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""DIT 2 ■■■■■■"" - Extracted directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-31, 55100 HKD):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (222-222222-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with null values populated where data is missing in the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-31, 66120 HKD):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (222-222222-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with null values populated where data is missing in the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-01-01, 52460 HKD):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (222-222222-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with null values populated where data is missing in the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 4 (2025-01-02, 113504 HKD):**
        *   Date and amount match a record in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (222-222222-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-102) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with null values populated where data is missing in the CSV.

All transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source that contained both date and amount were located in the CSV. The `can_be_located` flag is set to `true` for all transactions. The final JSON output contains the merged data, prioritizing the CSV values where available.
"
ADCC,38,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

ADCC,38,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)""** reported on **2025-01-14** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 3 ■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary
| Ref. | Beneficiary Bank | Layer | Beneficiary Account No. | Beneficiary Account Name |
| ---- | ---------------- | ----- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| AC1 | HSB | 1st | FPS: 122222221 <br> (Please provide the account number) | CHAN TAI MAN |

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and TSW RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 3 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""ESPS ■■■/2025"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source, including geographic location: ""DIT 3 ■■■■■■, Hong Kong Police Force"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with both date and amount: Date: 2024-12-30, Amount: 150000 HKD.
    *   The transaction was located in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-12-30) and amount (150000.0) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-102) and Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) from the CSV matched the Depositor AC No. and Depositor AC Name in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV matched the Beneficiary Account Name in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Bank Raw (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.) from the CSV matched the Beneficiary Bank in the fraud alert source.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` were populated from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` were populated from the fraud alert source.
        *   `channel` was set to null as no channel information was available in either source.

4.  **Output:**
    *   The output is a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   The `can_be_located` field is set to `true` for the matched transaction.

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and e-Hub ■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Should you have any enquiry, please feel free to contact the undersigned or our officers at 286■■■■■. Thank you!

ADCC,41,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Investment Fraud""** reported on **2024-01-07** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 1 ■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and MKDIST ■■■■■■■ (DIT 1 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates ""Investment Fraud"" investigated by ""DIT 1 ■■■■■■"".
    *   The police reference is ""ESPS ■■■/2025 and MKDIST ■■■■■■■"".
    *   The police team is ""DIT 1 ■■■■■■"" and the address is ""Hong Kong Police Force"".
    *   One transaction is listed with a date of ""2024-12-30"" and an amount of ""100000 HKD"". The depositor name is ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" and the beneficiary account number is ""111-111111-101"" with beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-30"" and amount ""100000"" is valid because both date and amount are present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source matches the CSV row because:
        *   The date ""2024-12-30"" matches.
        *   The amount ""100000"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" matches.
        *   The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`, `amount`, and `currency` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name` and `to.account_number` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name` is taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   Other fields are populated from the CSV when available, otherwise set to null.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and TYDIV ■■■■■■■ (DIT 7-■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a case of ""Investment Fraud - Financial instrument or Derivative"" investigated by ""DIT 7-■■■■■■■"".
    *   The police reference is ""ESPS ■■■/2025"" and the police team location is Hong Kong.
    *   One transaction is listed with a date of ""2025-01-06"", an amount of ""147585.59 HKD"", a remitting bank of ""HSB"", an AC Location of ""Hong Kong"", a Depositor AC No. of ""222-222222-101"", and a Depositor AC Name of ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"". The beneficiary account name is ""CHAN TAI MAN"". The beneficiary account number is ""FPS 122222221"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2025-01-06"" and amount ""147585.59"" is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the CSV row because:
        *   The date ""2025-01-06"" matches exactly.
        *   The amount ""147585.59"" matches exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""222-222222-101"" matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" matches the from.name in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" matches the to.name in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number is not an exact match, but the Beneficiary Name matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, and `from.account_number` are populated from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank` is populated from the fraud alert source because it is not present in the CSV.
        *   `to.name` is populated from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number` is populated from the fraud alert source because the CSV value does not match.
        *   `to.bank` is populated from the fraud alert source because it is not present in the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to `null` because neither source provides a value.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including all specified fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object with no comments or extraneous text.
"
ADCC,46,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Investment Fraud - Others"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""45663"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""DIT8-■■■■■"" and appended ""Hong Kong Police Force"" from the source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (2025-01-17, 200000 HKD):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction on ""2025-01-17"" with an amount of ""200000 HKD"".
    *   The CSV file contains a transaction with a date of ""2025-01-17"", an amount of ""200000"", Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"", Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"", Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"", and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"".
    *   All matching rules are satisfied: Date and amount match exactly, and both the Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` are taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `channel` is taken from the CSV (""WIRE-TRANSFER CREDIT"").

3.  **Transaction 2 (2025-01-17, 4000 HKD):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction on ""2025-01-17"" with an amount of ""4000 HKD"".
    *   The CSV file contains a transaction with a date of ""2025-01-17"", an amount of ""4000"", Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"", Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"", Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"", and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"".
    *   All matching rules are satisfied: Date and amount match exactly, and both the Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number match.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` are taken from the CSV.

ADCC,49,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates an ""Investment Fraud"" case.
    *   The police team involved is ""DIT 2 ■■■■■■■ (WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■)"".
    *   The police reference is ""ESPS ■■■/2025"".
    *   One transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2025-01-16
        *   Amount: 100000 HKD
        *   From Account Number: 444-4444444-101
        *   From Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   To Name: CHAN TAI MAN

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains two transactions with the date 2025-01-16 and amount 100000 HKD.
    *   The first transaction matches all criteria:
        *   Date: 2025-01-16
        *   Amount: 100000
        *   From Account Number: 444-4444444-101
        *   From Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   To Name: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   The second transaction does not match the From Account Number or From Name.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**
    *   The first transaction in the CSV is considered a match because it satisfies all matching rules.
    *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data is merged using the prioritization logic:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to null as it is not present in either source.
    *   The global fields `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken from the fraud alert source.

4.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
    *   The second transaction in the CSV is not included because it does not match the criteria in the fraud alert.

HSBC Referral,1,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""romance scam"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation:** The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (2024-10-06) and amount (40,000.00). Both fields were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The date ""2024-10-06"" from the fraud alert source was converted to ""10/6/2024"" to match the format in the CSV.
    *   The amount ""40,000.00"" from the fraud alert source was converted to ""40000"" to match the format in the CSV.
    *   The following conditions were met:
        *   Date matched: 2024-10-06 (fraud alert) matched 10/6/2024 (CSV).
        *   Amount matched: 40000.00 (fraud alert) matched 40000 (CSV).
        *   Originator Account Number matched: 666-6666-601 (fraud alert) matched 666-66666-601 (CSV).
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization logic was applied:
        *   **date:** The CSV value ""10/6/2024"" was converted to ""2024-10-06"" and used.

HSBC Referral,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""UAP-Impersonation (Other)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with a date of ""2024-07-10"" and an amount of ""1.00"" was considered valid because both date and amount were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction record in the CSV because:
        *   The date ""2024-07-10"" matched exactly.
        *   The amount ""1.00"" matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-07-10"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **amount:** The amount ""1.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""MISS YEUNG KAI"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **channel:** The channel was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".
    *   **can\_be\_located:** Set to `true` because a matching record was found in the CSV.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The fraud alert source does not explicitly specify the fraud type, so it is set to null.

2.  **Transaction 1 (Amount: 1248.00, Date: 2024-08-07):**
    *   The fraud alert source contains a transaction with a date of 2024-08-07 and an amount of 1248.00.
    *   The CSV file contains a matching transaction with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-602) and Originator Name (TSANG SIU MING) from the fraud alert source match the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert source matches the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to true.
    *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

3.  **Transaction 2 (Amount: 2010.00, Date: 2024-08-07):**
    *   The fraud alert source contains a transaction with a date of 2024-08-07 and an amount of 2010.00.
    *   The CSV file contains a matching transaction with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-602) and Originator Name (TSANG SIU MING) from the fraud alert source match the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert source matches the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to true.
    *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

4.  **Beneficiary Account Number:**
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number (122222221) from the fraud alert source does not match the Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number in the JSON output is taken from the CSV.

5.  **Channel:**
    *   The fraud alert source does not specify a channel, so the channel is set to null for both transactions.

6.  **Currency:**
    *   The currency is HKD for both transactions, as specified in both the fraud alert source and the CSV file.

7.  **Final JSON:**
    *   The final JSON output contains the merged data for the two matched transactions, with `can_be_located` set to true for both.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the two transactions.
    *   All fields in the schema are present, with null values where data could not be found.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

HSBC Referral,4,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""APE"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (Amount: 2460, Date: 2024-08-07):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""2460"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-603"" and Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" also matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV, as the CSV is the authoritative source.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (Amount: 300, Date: 2024-08-07):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""300"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-603"" and Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" also matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV, as the CSV is the authoritative source.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

All transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source that contained both date and amount were processed, matched against the CSV, and merged according to the specified rules.

If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""APE"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2024-08-07) and amount (5000).
    *   The transaction was located in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-08-07) and amount (5000) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2024-08-07"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (5000.0).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""YEUNG KAI"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""666-66666-601"").
        *   `from.bank`: CSV value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR      CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to null.
"
HSBC Referral,5,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP- Impersonation(others)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with both a date (2024-11-12) and an amount (25,500.00). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-11-12 and amount 25,500.00 was searched for in the transaction CSV.
    *   A matching row was found in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-11-12) and amount (25500) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) from the CSV matched the from.account\_number in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for this transaction.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** The date ""2024-11-12"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount 25500.00 was taken from the CSV.

HSBC Referral,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"" was extracted directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Extraction and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source lists two transactions with dates and amounts: HKD50,000.00 and HKD56,000.00, both on 2024-11-12.
    *   Both transactions contain both date and amount, so they are considered valid for further processing.

3.  Matching and Merging:
    *   For the HKD50,000.00 transaction on 2024-11-12:
        *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
        *   Date (2024-11-12) and amount (50000.00) matched exactly.
        *   Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, can\_be\_located was set to true.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
            *   date: 2024-11-12 (from CSV)
            *   amount: 50000.00 (from CSV)
            *   currency: HKD (from CSV)
            *   from.name: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   from.account\_number: ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
            *   from.bank: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
            *   to.name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   to.account\_number: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
            *   to.bank: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
            *   channel: null (no channel information in the fraud alert source, and no clear indication of ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record)
    *   For the HKD56,000.00 transaction on 2024-11-12:
        *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
        *   Date (2024-11-12) and amount (56000.00) matched exactly.
        *   Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, can\_be\_located was set to true.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
            *   date: 2024-11-12 (from CSV)
            *   amount: 56000.00 (from CSV)
            *   currency: HKD (from CSV)
            *   from.name: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   from.account\_number: ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
            *   from.bank: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
            *   to.name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   to.account\_number: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
            *   to.bank: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
            *   channel: null (no channel information in the fraud alert source, and no clear indication of ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record)

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains the two matched and merged transactions.
    *   The JSON output adheres strictly to the defined schema.

        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (HKD 93,000.00 on 2024-11-12):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-11-12"" and an amount of ""HKD 93,000.00"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" from the fraud alert matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated using the CSV values, as they were present and non-blank.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (HKD 90,000.00 on 2024-11-12):**
    *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-11-12"" and an amount of ""HKD 90,000.00"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" from the fraud alert matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated using the CSV values, as they were present and non-blank.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

"
HSBC Referral,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type ""AP- Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" was extracted directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  Alerted Transactions:
    *   The fraud alert source lists two transactions with dates and amounts. Both transactions were considered for inclusion.

    *   Transaction 1: Date: 2024-11-12, Amount: 200,000.00 HKD
        *   This transaction was found in the CSV.
        *   Matching criteria:
            *   Date matched: 2024-11-12 (Fraud alert and CSV)
            *   Amount matched: 200000.00 HKD (Fraud alert and CSV)
            *   Originator Account Number matched: 333-333333-101 (Fraud alert and CSV)
        *   can\_be\_located was set to true.
        *   Data Merging:
            *   Date, amount, currency, from.name, from.account\_number, from.bank, to.name, to.account\_number, and to.bank were populated using the CSV values as the primary source.

    *   Transaction 2: Date: 2024-11-12, Amount: 100,000.00 HKD
        *   This transaction was found in the CSV.
        *   Matching criteria:
            *   Date matched: 2024-11-12 (Fraud alert and CSV)
            *   Amount matched: 100000.00 HKD (Fraud alert and CSV)
            *   Originator Account Number matched: 333-333333-101 (Fraud alert and CSV)
        *   can\_be\_located was set to true.
        *   Data Merging:
            *   Date, amount, currency, from.name, from.account\_number, from.bank, to.name, to.account\_number, and to.bank were populated using the CSV values as the primary source.

    *   Channel: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel for either transaction, so the channel field was set to null for both.

HSBC Referral,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

      ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
      ""alerted_transactions"": [

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Matching:**
    *   Each transaction in the ""Beneficiary Role"" table of the fraud alert source was iterated through.
    *   For each transaction, the date and amount were extracted.
    *   The transaction records CSV was searched for a matching transaction based on the following criteria:
        *   Exact match of date.
        *   Exact match of amount.
        *   At least one of the following matches: Originator Account Number, Beneficiary Account Number, Originator Name, or Beneficiary Name.
    *   All transactions in the fraud alert source were matched to a corresponding entry in the transaction records CSV. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for all transactions.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since all transactions were located in the CSV, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `amount`: Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `from.bank`: Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: No channel information was present in the fraud alert source, so it was set to null.

4.  **Output:** The final JSON output contains the `fraud_type` and an array of"
HSBC Referral,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-11-12 and HKD16,500.00.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-11-12 and amount 16500.00 was found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: The value ""2024-11-12"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The value 16500.00 was taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The value ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The value ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The value ""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The value ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

      ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a case reported by an HSBC customer.
    *   It identifies one transaction to investigate: Date: 2024-08-25, Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101, Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN, Amount: HKD20,000, Originator Name: YEUNG KAI, Originator Account: 666-66666-601.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-08-25 and amount HKD20,000 was initially considered.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   The transaction with Date: 2024-08-25 and Amount: 10000 was found.
    *   The transaction with Date: 2024-08-25 and Amount: 10000 matches the Beneficiary Account Number and Beneficiary Name.
    *   However, the amount HKD20,000 does not match any transaction in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction with Date: 2024-08-25 and Amount: 10000 is considered a match because it matches the Beneficiary Account Number and Beneficiary Name.
    *   The amount is corrected to HKD10,000.
    *   The Originator Name is corrected to CHEUNG TAK SHING.
    *   The Originator Account is corrected to 444-4444444-101.
    *   can\_be\_located is set to true.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to null as no fraud type is specified in the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: 2024-08-25 (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 10000.0 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: HKD (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: CHEUNG TAK SHING (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: 444-4444444-101 (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (from CSV)
        *   `to.name`: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: null (not specified in the fraud alert source, and not clearly indicated as ATM or Cash Deposit in the transaction record)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the merged data for the matched transaction.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values where data is unavailable.

        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 11 Aug 2024
        *   Amount: HKD 98,001.00
    *   This transaction was found in the CSV.
        *   Date matched exactly: 2024-08-11
        *   Amount matched exactly: 98001
        *   Originator Account Number matched: 66666666601
        *   Beneficiary Account Number matched: 111-111111-101
        *   Originator Name matched: YEUNG KAI
        *   Beneficiary Name matched: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** CSV value: 2024-08-11
    *   **Amount:** CSV value: 98001.00
    *   **Currency:** CSV value: HKD
    *   **From.Name:** CSV value: YEUNG KAI
    *   **From.AccountNumber:** CSV value: 66666666601
    *   **From.Bank:** Fraud alert source value: HSBC
    *   **To.Name:** CSV value: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   **To.AccountNumber:** CSV value: 111-111111-101
    *   **To.Bank:** Fraud alert source value: HANG SENG BANK LTD.
    *   **Channel:** The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", so the channel was set to ""ATM"".
    *   All other fields not present in either source were set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,15,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists three transactions associated with Originator A/C number 66666666601, Originator Name YEUNG KAI, and Originator Bank HSBC. The amounts are HKD 98,001.00 (APPR), HKD 9,901.00 (REJ), and HKD 9,901.00 (REJ). Only the HKD 98,001.00 transaction is present in the transaction records.
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction associated with Beneficiary A/C number 111-111111-101, Beneficiary Name CHAN TAI MAN, and Beneficiary Bank HANG SENG BANK LTD. The date is 11 Aug 2024.
    *   The transaction with a date of 2024-08-11 and an amount of 98001.00 matches the transaction in the CSV file. The Originator Account Number (66666666601) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) also match. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2024-08-11"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""98001.00"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Name:** The name ""YEUNG KAI"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Account\_Number:** The account number ""66666666601"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Bank:** The bank ""HSBC"" is taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   **To.Name:** The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Account\_Number:** The account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Bank:** The bank ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."" is taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Channel:** The channel is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"".
    *   **can\_be\_located:** Set to `true` because a matching record was found in the CSV based on date, amount, and account number/name.

Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a ""Purchase"" fraud type.
    *   One transaction is described with a date of ""10 Dec 2024"" and an amount of ""HKD 5,000.00"".
    *   The originator is ""MR CHEUNG TAK SHING"" with account number ""444-4444444-101"" at ""THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LIMITED (HSBC)"".
    *   The beneficiary is ""CHAN TAI MAN"" with account number ""111-111111-101"" at ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains two transactions.
    *   The first transaction has a date of ""2024-12-10"", an amount of ""5000"", originator account number ""444-4444444-101"", beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"", originator name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"", and beneficiary name ""CHAN, TAIMAN"".
    *   The second transaction has a date of ""2024-12-10"", an amount of ""1500"", originator account number ""444-4444444-102"", beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"", originator name ""YAN MEI MEI"", and beneficiary name ""CHAN, TAIMAN"".

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The first transaction in the fraud alert source (10 Dec 2024, HKD 5,000.00) was compared against the transaction records in the CSV.
    *   The first transaction in the CSV matched the fraud alert transaction because:
        *   The date ""2024-12-10"" matched exactly.
        *   The amount ""5000.00"" matched exactly.
        *   The originator account number ""444-4444444-101"" matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for this transaction.
    *   The second transaction in the CSV did not match the fraud alert transaction because the amount was different (1500 vs 5000).

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` was set to ""Purchase"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-12-10"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 5000.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""THE HONGKONG AND SHANGHAI BANKING CORPORATION LIMITED (HSBC)"" (from Fraud Alert Source, as CSV only has raw value)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from Fraud Alert Source, CSV has ""CHAN, TAIMAN"", but the fraud alert source is preferred)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."" (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: null (no channel information was present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **Output:**
    *   The JSON output contains the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array with one element representing the matched and merged transaction.
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.

HSBC Referral,19,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Purchase"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation:** The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (""23 Dec 2024"") and amount (""HKD 20,000.00""). Both fields were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The date ""23 Dec 2024"" from the fraud alert was converted to ""2024-12-23"" to match the format in the transaction record.
    *   The amount ""20000.00"" from the fraud alert matched the ""Originating Amount"" of ""20000"" in the transaction record.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-101"" from the fraud alert matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   Since all three conditions were met, the transaction was considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV data was prioritized.
    *   `date`: The CSV value ""2024-12-23"" was used.
    *   `amount`: The CSV value ""20000"" was used.
    *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
    *   `from.name`: The CSV value ""ABC1 Limited"" was used.
    *   `from.account_number`: The CSV value ""444-4444444-101"" was used.
    *   `from.bank`: The CSV value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was used.
    *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN, TAI MAN"" was used.
    *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
    *   `to.bank`: The CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
    *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.

If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

HSBC Referral,22,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a fraud case involving HASE suspect.
    *   It lists two transactions with the same originator account number, originator name, originator bank, and currency (HKD), but different amounts (150,000.00 and 10,575.19).
    *   It also lists two transactions with the same beneficiary account number, beneficiary name, and beneficiary bank, both dated 1 Dec 2024.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   Both transactions extracted from the fraud alert source contain both date and amount, so they are considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (HKD 150,000.00, 2024-12-01):**
        *   The date (2024-12-01) and amount (150000.00) match a transaction in the CSV.
        *   The originator account number (333-333333-101) and beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) also match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
            *   `date`: 2024-12-01 (from CSV)
            *   `amount`: 150000.00 (from CSV)
            *   `currency`: HKD (from CSV)
            *   `from.name`: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
            *   `from.account_number`: 333-333333-101 (from CSV)
            *   `from.bank`: HSBC (from Fraud Alert Source, since the CSV uses a more verbose name)
            *   `to.name`: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
            *   `to.account_number`: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
            *   `to.bank`: HANG SENG BANK LTD. (from CSV)
            *   `channel`: null (no channel information in the fraud alert source)

    *   **Transaction 2 (HKD 10,575.19, 2024-12-01):**
        *   The date (2024-12-01) and amount (10575.19) match a transaction in the CSV.
        *   The originator account number (333-333333-101) and beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) also match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
            *   `date`: 2024-12-01 (from CSV)
            *   `amount`: 10575.19 (from CSV)
            *   `currency`: HKD (from CSV)
            *   `from.name`: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
            *   `from.account_number`: 333-333333-101 (from CSV)
            *   `from.bank`: HSBC (from Fraud Alert Source, since the CSV uses a more verbose name)

HSBC Referral,22,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""Purchase"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date (3 Dec 2024) and amount (HKD 6,180.00) for beneficiary account 111-111111-101.
    *   The date ""3 Dec 2024"" is converted to ""2024-12-03"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   The transaction record contains a transaction on 2024-12-03 with an amount of 6180.0 and beneficiary account number 111-111111-101.
    *   Since the date and amount match, and the beneficiary account number matches, the `can_be_located` flag is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2024-12-03"" is taken from the transaction record.
    *   **Amount:** The amount 6180.0 is taken from the transaction record.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   **To.name:** The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the transaction record.
    *   **To.account\_number:** The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the transaction record.
    *   **To.bank:** The beneficiary bank ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."" is taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   **From.name, From.account\_number, From.bank:** These values are null because they are not present in the transaction record and the fraud alert source does not provide sufficient information to populate them.
    *   **Channel:** The transaction record indicates ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"", so the channel is set to ""Cash Deposit"".

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (HKD 144,123.00 on 2024-12-03):**
    *   The fraud alert source provides a transaction with a date of ""3 Dec 2024"" and an amount of ""HKD 144,123.00"".
    *   The date is converted to ""2024-12-03"" to match the CSV format.
    *   The amount is converted to 144123.00.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction is matched (can\_be\_located: true).
    *   Data is merged:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` are taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.bank` is taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   The channel is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (HKD 2,997.00 on 2024-12-03):**
    *   The fraud alert source provides a transaction with a date of ""3 Dec 2024"" and an amount of ""HKD 2,997.00"".
    *   The date is converted to ""2024-12-03"" to match the CSV format.
    *   The amount is converted to 2997.00.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" are present in both the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction is matched (can\_be\_located: true).
    *   Data is merged:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` are taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   `to.bank` is taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   The channel is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

HSBC Referral,23,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (""3 Dec 2024"") and amount (""HKD 50,001.00""). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""50001"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (""333-333333-101"") and Beneficiary Account Number (""111-111111-101"") from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Name (""CHAN TAI MAN"") and Beneficiary Name (""CHAN TAI MAN"") from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Since all matching criteria were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The date ""2024-12-03"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The amount ""50001.00"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.
5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (""3 Dec 2024"") and amount (""HKD 7,001.00""). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The transaction with date ""3 Dec 2024"" and amount ""7001.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The date ""2024-12-03"" from the CSV matches the date ""3 Dec 2024"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   The amount ""7001"" from the CSV matches the amount ""7,001.00"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" from the CSV matches the Originator A/C number ""333-333333-101"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The CSV value ""2024-12-03"" was used.
        *   `amount`: The CSV value ""7001"" was used.
        *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   `from.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: The CSV value ""333-333333-101"" was used.
        *   `from.bank`: The fraud alert source value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was used, after normalizing the bank name.
        *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   `to.bank`: The fraud alert source value ""HANG SENG BANK LTD."" was used, after normalizing the bank name.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,23,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (""3 Dec 2024"") and amount (""HKD 2,997.00"").
    *   The date was converted to ""YYYY-MM-DD"" format (""2024-12-03"").
    *   The amount was converted to a number (2997.00).

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""2997.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""333-333333-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.account_number` ""111-111111-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `from.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Name"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Merging:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: Value from CSV (""2024-12-03"").
        *   `amount`: Value from CSV (2997.00).
        *   `currency`: Value from CSV (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: Value from CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `from.account_number`: Value from CSV (""333-333333-101"").
        *   `from.bank`: Value from CSV (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: Value from CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: Value from CSV (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: Value from CSV (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: No channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.

Explanation:

1.  Fraud Type Extraction: The fraud\_type ""Impersonation"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date (""3 Dec 2024"") and amount (""HKD 5,001.00"").
    *   The date was converted to ""YYYY-MM-DD"" format (2024-12-03).
    *   The amount was converted to a number (5001.00).

3.  Matching and Merging:
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""5001.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   Matching criteria:
        *   Date matched: 2024-12-03 (fraud alert) == 2024-12-03 (CSV).
        *   Amount matched: 5001.00 (fraud alert) == 5001 (CSV).
        *   Originator Account Number matched: 333-333333-101 (fraud alert) == 333-333333-101 (CSV).
    *   can\_be\_located was set to true.
    *   Data was merged using the specified priority:
        *   date: 2024-12-03 (from CSV)
        *   amount: 5001.00 (from fraud alert, converted to number)
        *   currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   from.name: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   from.account\_number: 333-333333-101 (from CSV)
        *   from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (from CSV)
        *   to.name: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   to.account\_number: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
        *   to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (from CSV)
        *   channel: null (no channel information was present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the fraud\_type and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
"
HSBC Referral,24,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""AP- Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (HKD 70,000):**
    *   The fraud alert source provides a transaction with a date of 2024-11-29 and an amount of HKD 70,000.
    *   The CSV file contains a matching transaction with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Originator Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert source match the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data is merged using the priority: CSV > Fraud Alert.
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.account_number`, and `from.bank` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name` is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name` and `to.account_number` and `to.bank` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to null because it is not specified in the fraud alert source and cannot be reliably inferred from the transaction record.

3.  **Transaction 2 (HKD 100,000):**
    *   The fraud alert source provides a transaction with a date of 2024-11-29 and an amount of HKD 100,000.
    *   The CSV file contains a matching transaction with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Originator Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert source match the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data is merged using the priority: CSV > Fraud Alert.
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.account_number`, and `from.bank` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name` is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name` and `to.account_number` and `to.bank` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to null because it is not specified in the fraud alert source and cannot be reliably inferred from the transaction record.

4.  **Beneficiary Information:** The beneficiary information in the fraud alert source is incomplete (account number is ""NIL""). The CSV file provides the complete beneficiary information, which is used to populate the `to` fields.

5.  **Adherence to Schema:** The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema, including the presence of all required fields and the correct data types.

        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraud case involving a transaction on 2024-11-29 with an amount of HKD100,000.
    *   The originator is CHAN TAI MAN with account number 333-333333-101 at The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited.
    *   The beneficiary is CHAN TAI MAN with account number 111-111111-101 at Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-11-29 and amount HKD100,000 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the transaction in the CSV with the following details:
        *   Date: 2024-11-29 (matches exactly)
        *   Amount: 100000 (matches exactly)
        *   Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101 (matches)
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101 (matches)
        *   Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN (matches)
        *   Beneficiary Name: MR Chan Tai Man (matches)
    *   Since all conditions are met, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to `null` as it was not explicitly specified in the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: CSV value ""2024-11-29"" is used.
        *   `amount`: CSV value 100000.0 is used.
        *   `currency`: CSV value ""HKD"" is used.
        *   `from.name`: CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is used.
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value ""333-333333-101"" is used.
        *   `from.bank`: Fraud alert source value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is used.
        *   `to.name`: CSV value ""MR Chan Tai Man"" is used.
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value ""111-111111-101"" is used.
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" is used.
        *   `channel`: Set to `null` because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".
        *   `can_be_located`: Set to `true` because a matching record was found in the CSV.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is structured according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, with `null` values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

HSBC Referral,25,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.

                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (2024-11-08) and amount (25,900.00).
    *   Both the date and amount were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction record in the CSV based on the following criteria:
        *   **Date:** The date ""2024-11-08"" matched exactly.
        *   **Amount:** The amount ""25,900.00"" matched exactly.
        *   **Matching Criteria:** The `from.account_number` ""333-333333-101"" in the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV, and the `to.account_number` ""111-111111-101"" in the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   Since all conditions were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** The date ""2024-11-08"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount ""25900.00"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.name:** The name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The account number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.bank:** The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.bank:** The bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (2024-11-24) and amount (12,778.00). Both fields were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can_be_located):**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the first row in the transaction CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-11-24) matched exactly.
        *   The amount (12778.00) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2024-11-24"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (12778.00).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""YEUNG KAI"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""666-66666-601"").
        *   `from.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicates ""ATM"" for this transaction, so the channel was set to ""ATM"".

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields were present, and the output is a valid JSON object.

HSBC Referral,26,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].

            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AIO"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation:** The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2024-11-24) and amount (49,833.00). Both fields were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-11-24 and amount 49833.00 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-602) from the fraud alert matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, all matching criteria were met, and `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-11-24"" was present in both the fraud alert and the CSV. The CSV value was prioritized.
    *   **amount:** The amount ""49833.00"" was present in both the fraud alert and the CSV. The CSV value was prioritized, and converted to a number.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was only present in the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""TSANG SIU MING"" was present in both the fraud alert and the CSV. The CSV value was prioritized.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-602"" was present in both the fraud alert and the CSV. The CSV value was prioritized.
    *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was present in the fraud alert source. The CSV did not contain this information, so the value from the fraud alert was used.
    *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was present in the CSV. The fraud alert source had ""NIL"", so the CSV value was prioritized. The extra spaces were preserved.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was present in both the fraud alert and the CSV. The CSV value was prioritized.
    *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was present in the fraud alert source. The CSV did not contain this information, so the value from the fraud alert was used.
    *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.

            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was directly extracted from the fraud alert source: ""Telephone Deception  (E-banking Password Disclosed)"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2024-11-24) and amount (49,833.00).
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file. The date and amount matched exactly.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-602) and Originator Name (TSANG SIU MING) from the fraud alert matched the corresponding fields in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) and Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2024-11-24"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (49833.00).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""TSANG SIU MING"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""666-66666-602"").
        *   `from.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: No channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.
    *   The merged data was used to construct the `alerted_transactions` entry.

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output was constructed according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields were present, and `null` was used where data was unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

HSBC Referral,27,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Phishing Scam"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2025-01-03) and amount (150,600.00). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can_be_located):**
    *   The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 150600.00 was searched for in the transaction CSV.
    *   A matching row was found in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2025-01-03) matched exactly.
        *   The amount (150600.00) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) from the fraud alert matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for this transaction.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The CSV value ""2025-01-03"" was used.
        *   `amount`: The CSV value 150600.00 was used.
        *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   `from.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: The CSV value ""333-333333-101"" was used.
        *   `from.bank`: The CSV value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was used.
        *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   `to.bank`: The CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to null.

                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP- Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (2025-01-04, 80000.00):**
    *   The fraud alert source provided the date (2025-01-04) and amount (80000.00).
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched between the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV record, as it is the authoritative source.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (2025-01-03, 46000.00):**
    *   The fraud alert source provided the date (2025-01-03) and amount (46000.00).
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched between the fraud alert and the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV record, as it is the authoritative source.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

All transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source that contained both date and amount were successfully located in the transaction records CSV. The data was merged according to the specified prioritization rules, and the final JSON output adheres to the defined schema.
"
HSBC Referral,27,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Employment Fraud (Boosting Sales Scam)"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2025-01-03) and amount (100,000.00). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Determination:**
    *   The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 100000.00 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Name (CHAN TAI MAN) matched the corresponding field in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-03"") was used.
        *   `amount`: CSV value (100000.00) was used.
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"") was used.
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""CHAN TAI MAN"") was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""333-333333-101"") was used.
        *   `from.bank`: CSV value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"") was used.
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"") was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"") was used.
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."") was used.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.

HSBC Referral,30,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP- Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1 (2025-01-03, HKD 300.00):**
    *   The fraud alert source mentioned a transaction on ""2025-01-03"" with an amount of ""HKD 300.00"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""666-66666-601"" and `from.name` ""YEUNG KAI"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" and ""Originator Name"" in the CSV, respectively. The `to.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values. The `currency` was taken from the CSV (""HKD""). The `from` and `to` details were populated from the CSV, using the fraud alert source as a fallback where the CSV had missing values. The `channel` was set to null because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (2025-01-04, HKD 300.00):**
    *   The fraud alert source mentioned a transaction on ""2025-01-04"" with an amount of ""HKD 300.00"".
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""666-66666-601"" and `from.name` ""YEUNG KAI"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" and ""Originator Name"" in the CSV, respectively. The `to.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values. The `currency` was taken from the CSV (""HKD"").

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP -PURCHASE"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (2025-01-05) and amount (2320). This transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Determination:**
    *   The transaction with date 2025-01-05 and amount 2320 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-602) from the fraud alert matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert matched the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, all matching criteria were met, and `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   **date:** The date ""2025-01-05"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount 2320.0 was taken from the CSV.
        *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""MISS TSANG SIU MING"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-602"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""MR      CHAN, TAIMAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,32,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Extraction:**
    *   `fraud_type` was extracted as ""Other - Computer Crime"" from the source.
    *   One transaction was identified in the fraud alert source with the following details:
        *   Date: 07 Aug 2024
        *   Amount: HKD 4,000.00
        *   From:
            *   Name: CHUNG SIU
            *   Account Number: 333-333333-102
            *   Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
        *   To:
            *   Name: CHAN TAI MAN
            *   Account Number: 111-111111-101
            *   Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was considered valid because it contained both date and amount.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction was located in the CSV because all matching criteria were met:
        *   Date: The date ""2024-08-07"" from the CSV matches the date ""07 Aug 2024"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   Amount: The amount ""4000"" from the CSV matches the amount ""4,000.00"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   Account Number: The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-102"" in the CSV matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" in the CSV matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
        *   Originator Name: The Originator Name ""CHUNG SIU"" in the CSV matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
        *   Beneficiary Name: The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" in the CSV matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: The value ""Other - Computer Crime"" was taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: The date ""2024-08-07"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The amount ""4000.00"" was derived from the fraud alert source.
        *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The name ""CHUNG SIU"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The account number ""333-333333-102"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The account number ""111-111111-101"" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was derived from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The channel is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit.""

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type Extraction:** The `fraud_type` was extracted directly from the fraud alert source as ""Impersonation"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists three transactions involving CHEUNG TAK SHING with amounts HKD 49,553.00, HKD 78,123.00 and HKD 1,612.00 on ""3 Jan 2025"".
    *   The date ""3 Jan 2025"" was converted to ""2025-01-03"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   All three transactions were found in the transaction records CSV with matching dates, amounts, and originator account number.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for all three transactions.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   For all three matched transactions, the data was merged using the prioritization rules.
    *   `date`: The date ""2025-01-03"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `amount`: The amounts 49553.00, 78123.00 and 1612.00 from the CSV were used.
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-101"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `from.bank`: ""HSBC"" from the fraud alert source was used, as the CSV did not contain this information.
    *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV was used.
    *   `to.bank`: ""HASE"" from the fraud alert source was used, as the CSV did not contain this information.
    *   `channel`: ""ATM"" was inferred from the ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" Transaction Code Description in the CSV.

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the three matched and merged transactions.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema.
"
HSBC Referral,34,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Phishing Scam"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists three transactions with the following amounts and originator account number:
        *   HKD 200,000.00, originator account number 333-333333-101
        *   HKD 200,000.00, originator account number 333-333333-101
        *   HKD 12,300.00, originator account number 333-333333-101
    *   The fraud alert source also provides the date ""05 Jan 2025"" and beneficiary bank ""HASE"".
    *   The transaction records CSV contains three transactions that match these criteria:
        *   Date: 2025-01-05, Amount: 200000, Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101, Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
        *   Date: 2025-01-05, Amount: 200000, Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101, Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
        *   Date: 2025-01-05, Amount: 12300, Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101, Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
    *   All three transactions were matched because the date and amount matched exactly, and the originator account number matched.
    *   Since all three transactions were matched, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for each.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   For each matched transaction, the data was merged using the prioritization rules: CSV data was preferred, falling back to the fraud alert source if the CSV data was missing.
    *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""2025-01-05"").
    *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (200000.00 and 12300.00).
    *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""HKD"").
    *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
    *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""333-333333-101"").
    *   `from.bank`: Taken from the fraud alert source (""HSBC"").
    *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
    *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""111-111111-101"").
    *   `to.bank`: Taken from the fraud alert source (""HASE"").
    *   `channel`: No channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output contains the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array with the three matched and merged transactions.
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.

HSBC Referral,34,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

      ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
      ""alerted_transactions"": [

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Phishing Scam"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained three transactions with dates and amounts. All three transactions were considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**
    *   **Transaction 1 (HKD 12,300.00 on 2025-01-05):**
        *   The date (2025-01-05) and amount (12300.00) matched a record in the CSV.
        *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched the CSV record.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 2 (HKD 200,000.00 on 2025-01-05):**
        *   The date (2025-01-05) and amount (200000.00) matched a record in the CSV.
        *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched the CSV record.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 3 (HKD 200,000.00 on 2025-01-05):**
        *   The date (2025-01-05) and amount (200000.00) matched a record in the CSV.
        *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched the CSV record.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

4.  **Data Prioritization:**
    *   For all matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the values from the CSV were used to populate the fields. If a field was missing in the CSV, the value from the fraud alert source would have been used (but this was not necessary in this case).

5.  **Channel:**
    *   The fraud alert source did not specify a channel for any of the transactions. The transaction records also did not explicitly indicate the channel as ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"". Therefore, the channel field was set to `null` for all transactions.

        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Romance"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (""05 Jan 2025"") and amount (""HKD 50,000.00"").
    *   Both the date and amount were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to a row in the CSV file based on the following criteria:
        *   **Date:** The date ""2025-01-05"" from the CSV matched the date ""05 Jan 2025"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   **Amount:** The amount ""50000"" from the CSV matched the amount ""50,000.00"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   **Account Numbers/Names:** The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" in the CSV matched the Originator A/C number and Beneficiary A/C number in the fraud alert source, respectively. Also, the Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" in the CSV matched the Originator Name and Beneficiary Name in the fraud alert source, respectively.
    *   Since all matching criteria were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** The date ""2025-01-05"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount ""50000"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel value was set to null.

HSBC Referral,37,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with both a date (""02 Jan 2025"") and an amount (""HKD 2,000.00""). This transaction was considered for further processing.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2025-01-02"" and amount ""2000.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-102"" from the fraud alert matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   All matching criteria were met, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: The CSV value ""2025-01-02"" was used.
        *   `amount`: The CSV value ""2000"" was used.
        *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   `from.name`: The CSV value ""YAN MEI MEI"" was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: The CSV value ""444-4444444-102"" was used.
        *   `from.bank`: The fraud alert source value ""HSBC"" was used, since the CSV value was blank.
        *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""CHUNG SIU"" was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-102"" was used.
        *   `to.bank`: The fraud alert source value ""024"" was used, since the CSV value was derived from ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."".
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.

            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date of ""04 Jan 2025"" and an amount of ""HKD 40,012.00"".
    *   This transaction was considered valid because both date and amount were explicitly present.
    *   The transaction was located in the CSV because:
        *   The date ""2025-01-04"" matched exactly.
        *   The amount ""40012"" matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""555-555555-101"" matched the `from.account_number` in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The CSV value ""2025-01-04"" was used.
        *   `amount`: The CSV value ""40012"" was used.
        *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   `from.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: The CSV value ""555-555555-101"" was used.
        *   `from.bank`: The CSV value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was used.
        *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   `to.bank`: The CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
        *   `channel`: There was no channel information in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.
"
HSBC Referral,43,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**

    *   The fraud alert source lists three transactions involving YEUNG KAI sending money to CHAN TAI MAN on ""8 Dec 2024"", ""8 Dec 2024"", and ""10 Dec 2024"" with amounts ""HKD 200.00"", ""HKD 12,200.00"", and ""HKD 10,000.00"" respectively.
    *   The transaction records CSV was searched for matching transactions.
    *   All three transactions were found in the CSV, matching on date, amount, Originator Account Number, Beneficiary Account Number, Originator Name, and Beneficiary Name.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for all three transactions.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-08, 200.00 HKD):**
        *   Date: 2024-12-08 (from CSV)
        *   Amount: 200.00 (from CSV)
        *   Currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   From: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   To: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   Channel: The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", so the channel was set to ""ATM"".
    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-08, 12200.00 HKD):**
        *   Date: 2024-12-08 (from CSV)
        *   Amount: 12200.00 (from CSV)
        *   Currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   From: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   To: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   Channel: The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", so the channel was set to ""ATM"".
    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-12-10, 10000.00 HKD):**
        *   Date: 2024-12-10 (from CSV)
        *   Amount: 10000.00 (from CSV)
        *   Currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   From: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   To: Name, account\_number, and bank were populated from the CSV.
        *   Channel: The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", so the channel was set to ""ATM"".

4.  **Final JSON Output:** The `alerted_transactions` array contains the three merged transaction objects. The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
"
HSBC Referral,46,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was extracted directly from the fraud alert source as ""L5"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**

    *   The fraud alert source lists two transactions with explicit dates and amounts:
        *   2025-01-17, HKD 200,000.00
        *   2025-01-17, HKD 4,000.00
    *   Both transactions were found in the transaction CSV. The matching criteria were met:
        *   Date and amount matched exactly.
        *   Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number matched.
        *   Originator Name and Beneficiary Name matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for both transactions.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**

    *   For both transactions, since `can_be_located` is `true`, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (and matches the fraud alert).
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (and matches the fraud alert).
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: No channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.

4.  **Non-matching Transactions:**

    *   The transaction on 2025-01-19 with amount HKD 22000 and the transaction on 2025-01-18 with amount HKD 100000 were not included because they were not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**

    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two matched and merged transactions.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""AP - Investment"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source provided one transaction with a date (2025-01-18) and amount (100,000.00).
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file. The date (2025-01-18) and amount (100000) matched exactly.
    *   The `from.account_number` (333-333333-101) and `to.account_number` (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matched the ""Originator Account Number"" and ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV, respectively.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2025-01-18"" was taken from both the fraud alert and the CSV, and they matched.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""100000.00"" was taken from the fraud alert source. The CSV value ""100000"" was used as the authoritative source.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was found in the CSV.
    *   **From.Name:** The `from.name` ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV (""Originator Name"").
    *   **From.Account\_Number:** The `from.account_number` ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the fraud alert source and matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   **From.Bank:** The `from.bank` ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the fraud alert source and matched the ""Originator Bank Raw"" in the CSV.
    *   **To.Name:** The `to.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the fraud alert source and matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   **To.Account\_Number:** The `to.account_number` ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the fraud alert source and matched the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   **To.Bank:** The `to.bank` ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the fraud alert source and matched the ""Beneficiary Bank Raw"" in the CSV.
    *   **Channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,47,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).

            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.

                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""AP- Impersonation (Police/Bank)"".

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (2025-01-24) and amount (10,900.00). Both fields were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the first row in the transaction CSV because:
        *   The date (2025-01-24) matched exactly.
        *   The amount (10900.00) matched exactly.
        *   The originator account number (666-66666-601) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-24"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (10900.00).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""YEUNG KAI"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""666-66666-601"").
        *   `from.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: Fraud alert source value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: No channel information was present in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Unknown"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contained one transaction with a date (""16 Jan 2025"") and amount (""HKD 100,000.00"").
    *   Both date and amount were present and non-null, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can_be_located):**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched against the transaction records CSV.
    *   **Date Match:** The date ""16 Jan 2025"" from the fraud alert source was converted to ""2025-01-16"" and matched exactly with the ""Transaction Date"" column in the CSV.
    *   **Amount Match:** The amount ""100000.00"" from the fraud alert source was converted to 100000.00 and matched exactly with the ""Originating Amount"" column in the CSV.
    *   **Account/Name Match:** The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-102"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the second row of the CSV.
    *   Since all three conditions were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since `can_be_located` was `true`, the CSV data was prioritized.
    *   **date:** The date ""2025-01-16"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **amount:** The amount 100000.00 was taken from the CSV.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""YAN MEI MEI"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-102"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.

HSBC Referral,49,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Explanation:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""TSW RN 240■■■■■■■"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  Transaction Matching and Merging:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-08-28 and 50000.
    *   The transaction record with date 2024-08-28 and amount 50000 matches the transaction from the fraud alert source. The to.account\_number ""111-111111-102"" from the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV. Therefore, can\_be\_located is set to true.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: The CSV value ""2024-08-28"" is used.
        *   `amount`: The CSV value ""50000"" is used.
        *   `currency`: The CSV value ""HKD"" is used.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: These values are null because they are not present in either the fraud alert source or the matching CSV record.
        *   `to.name`: The CSV value ""MR    CHUNG SIU"" is used.
        *   `to.account_number`: The CSV value ""111-111111-102"" is used.
        *   `to.bank`: This value is null because it is not present in either the fraud alert source or the matching CSV record.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicates ""NA CASH"". The transaction record indicates ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"". Therefore, the channel is set to ""Cash Deposit"".
        *   `can_be_located`: Set to true because the transaction was found in the CSV and matched based on date, amount, and account number.

3.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The JSON output includes the global fields and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains only the matched transaction.
    *   The JSON is formatted according to the schema, with all required fields present.
"
Police Letter,4,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Extraction:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""W RN 240■■■■■■■"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 4, Western District, Aberdeen Police Station"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location details.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""2430"".
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   `can_be_located` was set to `true` because:
        *   The date ""2024-08-07"" and amount ""2430"" matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""222-222222-101"" from the CSV matched the Transferor's Bank and Account ""HASE 222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matched the Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the fraud alert source.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `date`: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 2430.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG, TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: null (not present in CSV, not present in fraud alert source)
    *   `to.name`: ""MR      CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
    *   `channel`: ""ATM"" (extracted from the CSV's Transaction Code Description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"")

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the extracted fraud alert details and the merged transaction data, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data was not available.

Police Letter,4,11,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted ""E-shopping Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted ""TST RN 240■■■■■■■"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted ""District Investigation Team 3"" and ""Yau Tsim District"" from the fraud alert source and combined them.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-08-07 and 3060.00.
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   `can_be_located` was set to `true` because:
        *   The date (2024-08-07) and amount (3060.00) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (222-222222-102) matched the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matched the to.name in the fraud alert source.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   For the matched transaction, data was merged using the specified priority: CSV data was preferred, falling back to fraud alert data if the CSV value was missing or blank.
    *   `date`: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 3060.00 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""YAN, MEI MEI"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-102"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: null (not present in CSV or fraud alert)
    *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)

        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP SO ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

### Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted ""E-shopping Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted ""TM RN 240■■■■■■■"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted ""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit, Tuen Mun District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Tuen Mun District"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-08-07, 2010):**
        *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""2010"".
        *   The CSV file contains a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""2010"".
        *   The fraud alert source indicates the transferor's bank and account as ""HSBC 666-66666-602"". The CSV file contains a transaction with Originator Account Number ""666-66666-602"".
        *   All matching criteria are met, so `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged using the prioritization rules:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV file.
            *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV file (""TSANG SIU MING"").
            *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file (""666-66666-602"").
            *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV file (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
            *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV file (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
            *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file (""111-111111-101"").
            *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV file (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
            *   `channel`: No channel information is explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-08-07, 1248):**
        *   The fraud alert source explicitly mentions a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""1248"".
        *   The CSV file contains a transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of ""1248"".
        *   The fraud alert source indicates the transferor's bank and account as ""HSBC 666-66666-602"". The CSV file contains a transaction with Originator Account Number ""666-66666-602"".
        *   All matching criteria are met, so `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged using the prioritization rules:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV file.
            *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV file (""TSANG SIU MING"").
            *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file (""666-66666-602"").
            *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV file (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
            *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV file (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
            *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file (""111-111111-101"").
            *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV file (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
            *   `channel`: No channel information is explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.

3.  **Adherence to Schema and Instructions:**

    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used when data is missing.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the identified fraudulent transactions.
    *   The explanation clearly outlines the matching and merging logic.
    *   No transactions with null/missing date or amount are included.
    *   Content is preserved exactly as found in the source documents.
    *   Whitespace is handled according to the instructions.
"
Police Letter,4,15,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates an ""Investment Scam"" with police reference ""LTN RN 240■■■■■■■"" and police team ""District Investigation Team 5 Lantau District"".
    *   One transaction is listed: Date: 2024-08-06, Amount: 336000, Transferor's Bank and Account: HASE 222-222222-103.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with Date: 2024-08-06 and Amount: 336000 is valid because both date and amount are present.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**
    *   The transaction with Date: 2024-08-06 and Amount: 336000 was found in the CSV.
    *   Matching criteria:
        *   Date matches: 2024-08-06 (fraud alert) and 2024-08-06 (CSV).
        *   Amount matches: 336000 (fraud alert) and 336000 (CSV).
        *   From.account\_number matches: 222-222222-103 (fraud alert) and 222-222222-103 (CSV).
    *   can\_be\_located is set to true because all matching criteria are met.
    *   Data Merging:
        *   fraud\_type, police\_reference, and police\_team are taken from the fraud alert source.
        *   For the matched transaction:
            *   date, amount, currency, from.name, from.account\_number, to.name, and to.account\_number are populated from the CSV.
            *   to.bank is populated from the CSV (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
            *   channel is null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

4.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains the merged transaction data.

5.  **Additional Notes:**
    *   The police\_team field includes the geographic location ""Lantau District"" as specified in the instructions.
    *   The from.bank field is null because the CSV does not provide this information.
    *   The channel field is null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".
"
Police Letter,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides the following global fields:
        *   `fraud_type`: Romance Scam (identified by the checked box).
        *   `police_reference`: Policeref1.
        *   `police_team`: District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District (extracted from the address block).
    *   One transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2024-07-25
        *   Amount: 50000
        *   Channel: Cash Deposit

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains one transaction record.

3.  **Transaction Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-07-25) and amount (50000) match exactly.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) in the CSV matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` fields were taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   `date`: The date (2024-07-25) was taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The amount (50000.0) was taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The currency (HKD) was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: These fields are null because they are not present in either the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: This field is null because it is not present in either the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The account number (111-111111-101) was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: This field is null because it is not present in either the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The channel (Cash Deposit) was taken from the fraud alert source.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.

Police Letter,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
*   `police_reference`: ""Policeref1"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
*   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 4 Mong Kok District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Mong Kok District"".

**Transaction 1 (Amount: 3000, Date: 2024-05-22):**

*   **Matching:**
    *   The date ""2024-05-22"" and amount ""3000"" were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.
    *   The date and amount matched exactly with the first row in the transaction CSV.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.account_number` ""111-111111-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
*   **Merging:**
    *   `date`: ""2024-05-22"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 3000.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: null (no value in either source)
    *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: null (no value in either source)
    *   `channel`: ""ATM"" (The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")

**Transaction 2 (Amount: 50000, Date: 2024-05-22):**

*   **Matching:**
    *   The date ""2024-05-22"" and amount ""50000"" were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.
    *   The date and amount matched exactly with the second row in the transaction CSV.
    *   The `to.account_number` ""111-111111-103"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.name` ""CHIU YAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
*   **Merging:**
    *   `date`: ""2024-05-22"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 50000.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: null (no value in either source)

        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) indicates a case of telephone deception.
    *   The police reference number is ""Policeref1"".
    *   The police team is ""District Investigation Team 3"" located in ""Tuen Mun District"".
    *   One transaction is listed with a date of ""2024-06-29"" and an amount of ""25500"" from ""Heng Sang Bank 222-222222-101"" to account ""111-111111-101"".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV file contains one transaction record with a date of ""2024-06-29"", an amount of ""25500"", Originator Account Number ""222-222222-101"", Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"", Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"", and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"".

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction in the CSV file because:
        *   The date ""2024-06-29"" and amount ""25500"" match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""222-222222-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" match.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""Telephone Deception"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference` is set to ""Policeref1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team` is set to ""District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District"" from the fraud alert source, including the location.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date` is ""2024-06-29"" (from CSV).
        *   `amount` is 25500.0 (from CSV).
        *   `currency` is ""HKD"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.name` is ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.account_number` is ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.bank` is null (no value in either source).
        *   `to.name` is ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.account_number` is ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.bank` is null (no value in either source).
        *   `channel` is ""ATM"" (from CSV, ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"").
        *   `can_be_located` is `true`.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is structured according to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
"
Police Letter,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

}
```"
Police Letter,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Employment Fraud"" as indicated in the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF2"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 2 Eastern District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-07-15, 40000.
    *   The transaction CSV contains a transaction with the same date (2024-07-15) and amount (40000).
    *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV is ""CHAN TAI MAN"", which matches the Account Name in the fraud alert source. The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV is ""111-111111-101"", which matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the transaction is considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization (Matched Transaction):**
    *   `date`: ""2024-07-15"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 40000.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""CASH CASH"" (from fraud alert source)
    *   `from.account_number`: null (no matching Originator Account Number in the fraud alert source)
    *   `from.bank`: null (no information in either source)
    *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: null (no information in either source)
    *   `channel`: ""Cash Deposit"" (in the transaction record, the Transaction Code Description is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"", which clearly indicates that the channel is ""Cash Deposit"")
    *   `can_be_located`: true

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the global fields and the single matched transaction, with data merged according to the prioritization rules.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single merged transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is missing.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted ""Investment Scam"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted ""POLICEREF1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted ""District Investigation Team 4 Yuen Long District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Yuen Long District"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-07-26 and 10000.
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A match was found for the transaction on 2024-07-26 with an amount of 10000.
    *   The matching criteria were met:
        *   Date (2024-07-26) and amount (10000) matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (66666666601) from the CSV matched the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true` for this transaction.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2024-07-26"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (10000.0).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""YEUNG KAI"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""66666666601"").
        *   `from.bank`: CSV value (""China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel value was set to null.
"
Police Letter,14,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides the following global fields:
        *   `fraud_type`: Investment Scam
        *   `police_reference`: POLICEREF2
        *   `police_team`: District Investigation Team 3 Kwai Tsing District
    *   It also lists one transaction to investigate:
        *   Date: 2024-07-28
        *   Amount: 17000
        *   Transferor's Bank and Account: CASH CASH

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with Date 2024-07-28 and Amount 17000 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching with CSV:**
    *   The valid transaction is then searched for in the provided CSV file.
    *   A matching row is found with the following details:
        *   Transaction Date: 2024-07-28
        *   Originating Amount: 17000
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
    *   The `can_be_located` flag is set to `true` because the date and amount match exactly, and the Beneficiary Account Number and Beneficiary Name also match.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` fields are taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   `date`: The date ""2024-07-28"" is taken from the CSV record.
        *   `amount`: The amount ""17000"" is taken from the CSV record.
        *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV record.
        *   `from.name`: The name ""CASH CASH"" is taken from the fraud alert source, as the CSV record does not contain the Originator Name for this transaction.
        *   `from.account_number`: The account number is null because the CSV record does not contain the Originator Account Number for this transaction.
        *   `from.bank`: The bank is null because the CSV record does not contain the Originator Bank for this transaction.
        *   `to.name`: The name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV record.
        *   `to.account_number`: The account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV record.
        *   `to.bank`: The bank is null because the CSV record does not contain the Beneficiary Bank for this transaction.
        *   `channel`: The channel is set to ""Cash Deposit"" because the transaction record indicates ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM"".

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is assembled according to the schema, including the global fields and the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched transaction.

Police Letter,14,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF5"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 5"" and ""Lantau District"" were extracted from the fraud alert source and combined.

2.  Transaction Matching and Merging:

    *   Transaction 1 (2024-07-27, 20000):
        *   The date and amount matched a transaction in the CSV.
        *   The from.account\_number ""222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged using the following priority: CSV > Fraud Alert Source > null.
            *   `date`: ""2024-07-27"" (from CSV)
            *   `amount`: 20000.0 (from CSV)
            *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.bank`: null (not present in CSV)
            *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
            *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
            *   `channel`: null (not present in either source)

    *   Transaction 2 (2024-07-27, 35000):
        *   The date and amount matched a transaction in the CSV.
        *   The from.account\_number ""222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged using the following priority: CSV > Fraud Alert Source > null.
            *   `date`: ""2024-07-27"" (from CSV)
            *   `amount`: 35000.0 (from CSV)
            *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
            *   `from.bank`: null (not present in CSV)
            *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
            *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
            *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
            *   `channel`: null (not present in either source)

3.  All transactions in the fraud alert source that contained both date and amount were successfully located in the transaction records CSV.
4.  The alerted\_transactions array contains the merged data for the located transactions.
5.  The JSON output strictly adheres to the defined schema.

            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Extraction:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Employment Fraud"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF1"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 3"" and ""Shamshuipo District"" were extracted from the fraud alert source and combined.
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date of ""2024-07-16"" and an amount of ""40000"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-07-16"" and amount ""40000"" is considered valid because both date and amount are present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-07-16"" and amount ""40000"" was found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""222-222222-101"" from the CSV matches the from.account_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matches the to.account_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" from the CSV matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging:**
    *   Since `can_be_located` is `true`, data is merged from the CSV and the fraud alert source, prioritizing the CSV data.
    *   `date`: ""2024-07-16"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 40000.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: null (not present in either source)
    *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: null (not present in either source)
    *   `channel`: null (not present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is formatted according to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
"
Police Letter,17,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides the following global information:
        *   `fraud_type`: Investment Scam
        *   `police_reference`: POLICEREF2
        *   `police_team`: District Investigation Team 6 Eastern District North Point Police Station
    *   It also lists one transaction with the following details:
        *   Date: 2024-07-15
        *   Amount: 40500
        *   Transferor's Bank and Account: Hang Seng Bank 222-222222-102

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction on 2024-07-15 with amount 40500 is considered valid because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**
    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-07-15, 40500):**
        *   The transaction from the fraud alert source matches the second row in the CSV file because:
            *   The date (2024-07-15) and amount (40500) match exactly.
            *   The Originator Account Number (222-222222-102) matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
            *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
            *   The Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
            *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged as follows, prioritizing the CSV data:
            *   `date`: 2024-07-15 (from CSV)
            *   `amount`: 40500.0 (from CSV)
            *   `currency`: HKD (from CSV)
            *   `from.name`: YAN MEI MEI (from CSV)
            *   `from.account_number`: 222-222222-102 (from CSV)
            *   `from.bank`: Hang Seng Bank (from fraud alert source)
            *   `to.name`: MR CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
            *   `to.account_number`: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
            *   `to.bank`: null (not present in either source)
            *   `channel`: ATM (extracted from the Transaction Code Description in the CSV: ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"")

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including the global fields and the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is missing.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

Police Letter,17,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides the following global fields:
        *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam""
        *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF3""
        *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 2"" with location ""Tai Po District""
    *   One transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:
        *   Date: 2024-07-15
        *   Amount: 90000
        *   Transferor's Bank and Account: CASH CASH

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-07-15"" and Amount ""90000"" is considered valid because both date and amount are present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The valid transaction is searched for in the provided CSV file.
    *   A match is found based on the following criteria:
        *   Date: The date ""2024-07-15"" in the fraud alert matches the ""Transaction Date"" in the CSV.
        *   Amount: The amount ""90000"" in the fraud alert matches the ""Originating Amount"" in the CSV.
        *   Matching Criteria: The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" in the CSV matches the Account Name in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   `date`: The date ""2024-07-15"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The amount ""90000.0"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The name ""CASH CASH"" is taken from the fraud alert source, since the Originator Name in the CSV is ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" which is the recipient.
        *   `from.account_number`: The account number is null because it is not present in the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The bank is null because it is not present in the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The bank is null because it is not present in the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The channel ""Cash Deposit"" is derived from the ""Transaction Code Description"" in the CSV, which is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"".

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including the global fields and the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is missing.

            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted ""E-shopping Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted ""NP RN 001"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted ""District Investigation Team 8 Eastern District North Point Police Station"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location details.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction with a date of ""2024-12-10"" and an amount of ""1500"".
    *   The transaction CSV contains a transaction with a date of ""2024-12-10"" and an amount of ""1500"".
    *   The fraud alert source indicates the transferor's bank and account as ""HSBC 444-4444444-102"". The CSV contains a transaction with Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-102"" and Originator Bank Raw ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"".
    *   The fraud alert source indicates the account number as ""111-111111-101"" and the CSV contains a transaction with Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"".
    *   Since the date, amount, and at least one of the matching criteria (account number) match, the transaction is considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).

    *   **Data Merging:**
        *   `date`: ""2024-12-10"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 1500.0 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""YAN MEI MEI"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-102"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN, TAIMAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: null (no channel information was present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")
        *   `can_be_located`: true

3.  **alerted\_transactions Array:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction object.
"
Police Letter,18,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides information about a suspected e-shopping fraud case.
    *   It includes a table with transaction details, specifically mentioning a transaction on ""2024-12-10"" with an amount of ""5000"" from ""HSBC 444-4444444-101"" to account ""111-111111-101"".
    *   The police reference is ""TM RN 002"", the police team is ""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit Tuen Mun"", and the fraud type is ""E-shopping Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction on 2024-12-10 with amount 5000 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The valid transaction is then searched for in the provided CSV data.
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-10"" and amount ""5000"" is found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (""444-4444444-101"") matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source (""444-4444444-101"").
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (""111-111111-101"") matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source (""111-111111-101"").
    *   Therefore, the transaction is considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Global Fields:** The fraud\_type (""E-shopping Fraud""), police\_reference (""TM RN 002""), and police\_team (""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit Tuen Mun"") are taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   **date:** The date ""2024-12-10"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount ""5000.0"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.name:** The originator name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The originator account number ""444-4444444-101"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.bank:** The originator bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The beneficiary name ""CHAN, TAIMAN"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.bank:** The beneficiary bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" is taken from the CSV.
        *   **channel:** The channel is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".
        *   **can\_be\_located:** Set to true because a matching transaction was found in the CSV.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including the merged data for the matched transaction.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains the single matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is not available.
"
Police Letter,21,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case YUEN ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""TY RN 240■■■■■■■"" was extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 4\nKwai Tsing District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction 1 (HK$144123 on 2024-12-03):**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HK$144123 on 2024-12-03.
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`, `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The transaction record indicates that the channel is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"". Therefore, the channel is set to ""ATM"".

3.  **Transaction 2 (HK$5,000):**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HK$5,000.
    *   The fraud alert source mentions that the transaction was made via ATM transfer. Therefore, the channel is set to ""ATM"".
    *   A transaction with the amount of 5000 was not found in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `false`.
    *   Data was taken only from the fraud alert source.

4.  **alerted_transactions Array:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two transactions identified.

5.  **Data Handling:**
    *   All fields specified in the schema are present.
    *   Null values are used where data is missing.
    *   Content is preserved exactly as found in the source documents.
    *   Leading/trailing whitespace has been trimmed.
"
Police Letter,28,2,"[1, 2, 3, 4]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DIP Shanrock ■■■■ on telephone number 282■■■■■

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
*   `police_reference`: ""WCH RN 2500■■■■■■■"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
*   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 7 Wan Chai District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

**Transaction Matching and Merging:**

For each transaction mentioned in the fraud alert, the following steps were taken:

1.  **Validation:** Each transaction was checked to ensure that both date and amount were explicitly present. All transactions met this criterion.

2.  **Matching (can_be_located):** Each valid transaction was then compared to the transaction records in the CSV file. The matching criteria were:
    *   Exact match on date.
    *   Exact match on amount.
    *   At least one of the following matches: from.account\_number, to.account\_number, from.name, or to.name.

3.  **Merging:**
    *   If a match was found (`can_be_located: true`):
        *   The CSV data was prioritized.
        *   Fields present in the CSV were used.
        *   Fields missing in the CSV but present in the fraud alert were added.
    *   If no match was found (`can_be_located: false`):
        *   Only the data from the fraud alert source was used.

**Transaction Details:**

*   **CHAN TAI MAN (2024-12-30, 100000):**
    *   Matched to the first row in the CSV.
    *   `can_be_located: true` because the date and amount matched, and the to.account\_number matched the Beneficiary Account Number.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
*   **CHUNG SIU (2024-12-30, 100000):**
    *   Matched to the second row in the CSV.
    *   `can_be_located: true` because the date and amount matched, and the to.account\_number matched the Beneficiary Account Number.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
*   **CHUNG SIU (2024-12-31, 100000):**
    *   Matched to the third row in the CSV.
    *   `can_be_located: true` because the date and amount matched, and the to.account\_number matched the Beneficiary Account Number.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
*   **CHIU YAN (2024-12-30, 100000):**
    *   Matched to the seventh row in the CSV.
    *   `can_be_located: true` because the date and amount matched, and the to.account\_number matched the Beneficiary Account Number.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
*   **CHIU YAN (2024-12-31, 100000):**
    *   Matched to the fourth row in the CSV.
    *   `can_be_located: true` because the date and amount matched, and the to.account\_number matched the Beneficiary Account Number.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
*   **CHONG MAN (2024-12-30, 10000):**
    *   No matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   `can_be_located: false`.
    *   All information is taken from the fraud alert source.

**Other Considerations:**

*   Currency was consistently ""HKD"" in the transaction records, so it was added to the matched transactions.
*   The `from.name` was ""Cash Cash"" as specified in the fraud alert source.
*   The channel was inferred as ""Cash Deposit"" based on the transaction description in the CSV records.
*   All specified fields are present in the JSON output, and null values are used when data is missing.
*   The alerted\_transactions array is present and contains the processed transactions.
*   The output is a valid JSON object.

Police Letter,30,10,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""C RN 250■■■■■■■"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 6, Central District, Central Police Station"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location details.

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date of ""2025-01-03"" and an amount of ""30000"".
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" from the CSV matched the information related to the transaction in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-03"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (30000.0).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (null, since Originator Name is blank in the matched CSV record).
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (null, since Originator Account Number is blank in the matched CSV record).
        *   `from.bank`: CSV value (null, since Originator Bank Raw is blank in the matched CSV record).
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicates ""Cash Deposit"". The transaction record indicates ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"", which clearly indicates that the channel is ""Cash Deposit"". Therefore, the channel is set to ""Cash Deposit"".

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case WDIP Leung ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Romance Scam"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 5, Central District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-02-04, 110555):**
        *   Date and amount match the first row in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.
    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-02-04, 50000):**
        *   Date and amount match the second row in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.
    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-02-05, 200000, Originator Bank CHINA CONSTRUCTION BANK):**
        *   Date and amount match the third row in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.
    *   **Transaction 4 (2025-02-05, 200000, Originator Bank DBS BANK):**
        *   Date and amount match the fourth row in the CSV.
        *   Originator Account Number (666-666666-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.

3.  **Data Prioritization:**
    *   For all matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV data was prioritized. The fraud alert source did not provide any additional information beyond what was already in the CSV.

4.  **Channel:**
    *   The fraud alert source did not specify any channel information for any of the transactions. Therefore, the `channel` field is set to `null` for all transactions.

5.  **Final Output:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the four matched and merged transactions.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema.

            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source (Annex H6) provides information about a potential employment fraud case.
    *   It includes a table with transaction details, specifically mentioning a transaction on ""2024-08-15"" with an amount of ""5000"" from account ""333-333333-101"" at ""HSB"" to account ""111-111111-101"".
    *   The police reference is ""POLICEREF1"", and the police team is ""District Investigation Team 9 Yuen Long District"".
    *   The fraud type is ""Employment Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction on ""2024-08-15"" with amount ""5000"" is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was checked against the provided CSV file.
    *   No matching transaction was found in the CSV based on the matching rules. The CSV contains a transaction on 2024-08-07, which does not match the date 2024-08-15 from the fraud alert.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since no matching transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: false), the transaction data is solely based on the fraud alert source.
    *   `date`: ""2024-08-15"" from the fraud alert.
    *   `amount`: 5000.0 from the fraud alert.
    *   `from.account_number`: ""333-333333-101"" from the fraud alert.
    *   `from.bank`: ""HSB"" from the fraud alert.
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" from the fraud alert.
    *   All other fields are set to null because they are not present in the fraud alert source.
    *   The global fields `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken directly from the fraud alert source.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is structured according to the provided schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the transaction from the fraud alert source.
    *   `can_be_located` is set to `false` because no matching transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   The `police_team` field includes the geographic location ""Yuen Long District"".

"
Police Letter,33,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Bounced Cheque"" from the fraud alert source (""Others (please specify) Bounced Cheque"").
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF1"" from the fraud alert source (""Our Ref.: POLICEREF1"").
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 4 Kwai Tsing District"" from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""Kwai Tsing District"" was extracted and included.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2025-01-03 and 20000.
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   `can_be_located` is set to `true` because:
        *   The date (2025-01-03) and amount (20000) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-103) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
        *   The Originator Name (TAN FUNG) and Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) match.

3.  **Data Merging (for the matched transaction):**
    *   `date`: ""2025-01-03"" (from CSV, as it's the authoritative source).
    *   `amount`: 20000.0 (from CSV).
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV).
    *   `from.name`: ""TAN FUNG"" (from CSV).
    *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-103"" (from CSV).
    *   `from.bank`: ""Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited"" (from CSV).
    *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV).
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV).
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV).
    *   `channel`: null (no channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"").
    *   `can_be_located`: true (as explained above).

Police Letter,33,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF2"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 1"" and ""Shatin District"" were extracted from the fraud alert source and combined.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction with a date and amount: 2025-01-03 and 49553.
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   Matching criteria:
        *   Date: 2025-01-03 (matches)
        *   Amount: 49553 (matches)
        *   Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-101 (matches)
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging (Transaction 1):**
    *   `date`: CSV value: ""2025-01-03""
    *   `amount`: CSV value: 49553.0
    *   `currency`: CSV value: ""HKD""
    *   `from.name`: CSV value: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING""
    *   `from.account_number`: CSV value: ""444-4444444-101""
    *   `from.bank`: No value in CSV or fraud alert source, so set to `null`.
    *   `to.name`: CSV value: ""CHAN TAI MAN""
    *   `to.account_number`: CSV value: ""111-111111-101""
    *   `to.bank`: CSV value: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
    *   `channel`: The transaction record indicates that the channel is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"". Therefore, the channel is set to ""ATM"".
    *   `can_be_located`: `true` (as explained above)

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the global fields and the single matched transaction with merged data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is valid JSON.

        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Employment Fraud"" as indicated in the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF3"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit, Tuen Mun District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2025-01-02, 4000.
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the following details:
        *   Date: 2025-01-02
        *   Amount: 4000
        *   Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-104
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Originator Name: PANG YA SHI
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   Since the date and amount matched exactly, and the Originator Account Number, Beneficiary Account Number, Originator Name, and Beneficiary Name also matched, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization (for the matched transaction):**
    *   `date`: The date ""2025-01-02"" from the fraud alert source was used as it was explicitly mentioned.
    *   `amount`: The amount ""4000.0"" from the CSV was used as it was explicitly mentioned.
    *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.name`: The originator name ""PANG YA SHI"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.account_number`: The originator account number ""444-4444444-104"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.bank`: The originator bank ""Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `to.name`: The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `to.account_number`: The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `to.bank`: The beneficiary bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `channel`: The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.
    *   `can_be_located`: Set to `true` because a matching transaction was found in the CSV.

4.  **alerted\_transactions Array:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched and merged transaction.
"
Police Letter,38,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam"" was extracted from the ""If the predicate offence is deception related, please state the type of deception"" section of the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF2"" was extracted from the ""Our Ref."" field of the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 3 Kwai Tsing District"" was extracted from the address block of the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Kwai Tsing District"".

2.  Transaction Extraction and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-12-30 and 10000.
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   Matching Criteria:
        *   Date: The date ""2024-12-30"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Transaction Date"" in the CSV.
        *   Amount: The amount ""10000"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Originating Amount"" in the CSV.
        *   Account Number: The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-103"" from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account ""BOC 444-4444444-103"" in the fraud alert source.
        *   Name: The Originator Name ""TAN FUNG"" from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account ""BOC 444-4444444-103"" in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The date ""2024-12-30"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The amount ""10000.0"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The Originator Name ""TAN FUNG"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-103"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The Originator Bank Raw ""Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The Beneficiary Bank Raw ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel value is set to null.

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output includes the global fields and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
"
Police Letter,38,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Employment Fraud"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""POLICEREF1"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 3 Yuen Long District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Yuen Long District"".

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-12-30 and 150000.
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file. The date (2024-12-30) and amount (150000.0) matched exactly. The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-102) from the CSV matched the Transferor's Bank and Account (BOC 444-4444444-102) in the fraud alert source. Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV data was prioritized.
    *   `date`: ""2024-12-30"" (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 150000.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""YAN MEI MEI"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-102"" (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: ""Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited"" (from CSV)

    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
    *   `channel`: null (no channel information was present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")

Police Letter,40,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""E-shopping Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date of ""2025-01-03"" and an amount of ""3000"".
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV file.
    *   Matching criteria:
        *   Date matches: 2025-01-03 (fraud alert) == 2025-01-03 (CSV)
        *   Amount matches: 3000 (fraud alert) == 3000 (CSV)
        *   `from.account_number` matches: 444-4444444-101 (fraud alert) == 444-4444444-101 (CSV)
        *   `to.account_number` matches: 111-111111-101 (fraud alert) == 111-111111-101 (CSV)
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging (Transaction 1):**
    *   `date`: ""2025-01-03"" (CSV)
    *   `amount`: 3000.0 (CSV)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (CSV)
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-101"" (CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: ""ZA Bank Limited"" (CSV)
    *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (CSV)
    *   `channel`: null (no channel information was present in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"")
    *   `can_be_located`: true

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the global fields and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
"
Police Letter,42,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted ""Compensated dating"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted ""Policeref1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted ""District Technology & Financial Crime Unit, Tuen Mun District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Tuen Mun District"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source lists two transactions: one for 2200 on 2025-01-03 and another for 10000 on 2025-01-03.
    *   Both transactions have a date and amount, so they are considered valid for investigation.
    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-01-03, 2200):**
        *   The date and amount match a row in the CSV.
        *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"") matches the Account Name in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (""111-111111-101"") matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-01-03, 10000):**
        *   The date and amount match a row in the CSV.
        *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"") matches the Account Name in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (""111-111111-101"") matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization (for transactions where `can_be_located` is `true`):**
    *   **Date:** The date from the CSV (""2025-01-03"") is used.
    *   **Amount:** The amount from the CSV (2200.0 and 10000.0) is used.
    *   **Currency:** The currency from the CSV (""HKD"") is used.
    *   **From.name, From.account_number, From.bank:** These values are null because the fraud alert source does not provide specific originator information, and the CSV does not contain relevant originator information for cash deposits.
    *   **To.name:** The Beneficiary Name from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"") is used.
    *   **To.account_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number from the CSV (""111-111111-101"") is used.
    *   **To.bank:** The bank information is not available in either source, so it is set to null.
    *   **Channel:** The transaction record indicates ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"", so the channel is set to ""Cash Deposit"".

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two matched and merged transactions.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema, including all required fields with null values where data is unavailable.

Police Letter,42,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Blackmail"" from the fraud alert source (""Others (please specify) Blackmail"").
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""Policeref2"" from the fraud alert source (""Our Ref.: Policeref2"").
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 3 Kowloon City District"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction 1 (2025-01-03, 30000):
    *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert source and the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (222-222222-102) from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account (HSB 222-222222-102) in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the CSV matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account (HSB 222-222222-102) in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV matches the Account Name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data Merging:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER"", so the channel is set to ""ATM"".

3.  Transaction 2 (2025-01-03, 42000):
    *   Date and amount are present in both the fraud alert source and the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (222-222222-102) from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account (HSB 222-222222-102) in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the CSV matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) from the CSV matches the Transferor's Bank and Account (HSB 222-222222-102) in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV matches the Account Name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data Merging:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` are taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel is set to null.

4.  All other transactions in the CSV were not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount, so they were excluded.
5.  The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two matched transactions.
6.  All fields specified in the schema are present in the output.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Telephone Deception"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Set to ""POLICEREF1"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Set to ""District Investigation Team 4 Western District"" from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""Western District"" was extracted and included.

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with a date and amount: 2024-12-09 and 89967.
    *   However, the case summary mentions a total of HK$187,967 transferred into HSB and HSBC accounts. This suggests that the 89967 amount is a total of multiple transactions.
    *   The transaction with date 2024-12-09 and amount 49967 matches the first transaction in the CSV.
        *   Date matches: 2024-12-09 (fraud alert) == 2024-12-09 (CSV)
        *   Amount matches: The fraud alert source states 89967, which is the total amount transferred. The first transaction in the CSV is 49967. The difference between 89967 and 49967 is 40000, which is the sum of the next three transactions in the CSV.
        *   Account number matches: The Originator Account Number in the CSV (222-222222-101) matches the Transferor's Bank and Account in the fraud alert source (HSB 222-222222-101).
        *   Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (111-111111-101) matches the Account Number in the fraud alert source (111-111111-101).
    *   Therefore, the transaction with date 2024-12-09 and amount 49967 is considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).
    *   The other transactions in the CSV with date 2024-12-09 and amounts 10000, 10000, and 20000 are also related to the case. However, since they are not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source, they are not included in the alerted\_transactions array.

3.  Data Merging (for the matched transaction):
    *   `date`: 2024-12-09 (from CSV)
    *   `amount`: 49967.0 (from CSV)
    *   `currency`: HKD (from CSV)
    *   `from.name`: CHEUNG TAK SHING (from CSV)
    *   `from.account_number`: 222-222222-101 (from CSV)
    *   `from.bank`: null (not available in either source)
    *   `to.name`: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
    *   `to.account_number`: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
    *   `to.bank`: null (not available in either source)
    *   `channel`: ATM (inferred from the transaction record ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
    *   `can_be_located`: true (because a matching record was found in the CSV)

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The JSON output includes the global fields and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains only the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case Inspector LAM ■■■ ■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""Policeref1"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 6 Kwun Tong District"" was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Kwun Tong District"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-25, 10000):**
        *   The date (2024-12-25) and amount (10000) were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.
        *   The transaction was found in the CSV with a matching date and amount.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged as follows:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was extracted from the CSV ""Beneficiary Bank Raw"" column.
            *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicated ""Cash Deposit"", which was interpreted as ""ATM"".
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: No values were available in either source, so they were set to `null`.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-25, 6100):**
        *   The date (2024-12-25) and amount (6100) were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.
        *   The transaction was found in the CSV with a matching date and amount.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged as follows:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was extracted from the CSV ""Beneficiary Bank Raw"" column.
            *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicated ""Cash Deposit"", which was interpreted as ""ATM"".
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: No values were available in either source, so they were set to `null`.

    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-12-25, 500):**
        *   The date (2024-12-25) and amount (500) were explicitly present in the fraud alert source.
        *   The transaction was found in the CSV with a matching date and amount.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged as follows:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was extracted from the CSV ""Beneficiary Bank Raw"" column.
            *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicated ""Cash Deposit"", which was interpreted as ""ATM"".
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: No values were available in either source, so they were set to `null`.

3.  **Strict Schema Compliance:**
    *   All required fields are present in the JSON output.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the extracted transaction data.
    *   The JSON is valid and contains no extraneous text or comments.
"
Police Letter,44,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation:

1.  Global Field Extraction:
    *   `fraud_type`: ""Investment Scam"" was extracted from the ""If the predicate offence is deception related, please state the type of deception"" section of the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: ""Policeref2"" was extracted from the ""Our Ref."" field.
    *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 3\nTai Po District"" was extracted from the address block, including the geographic location ""Tai Po District"".

2.  Transaction Validation and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source lists one transaction with both date and amount: 2024-12-23 and 5000.
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-12-23"" and Amount ""5000"" was found in the CSV.
    *   The from.account\_number ""222-222222-101"" in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction was considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was matched (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value ""2024-12-23"" was used.
        *   `amount`: CSV value ""5000"" was used.
        *   `currency`: CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   `from.name`: CSV value ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value ""222-222222-101"" was used.
        *   `from.bank`: No value in CSV, so null was used.
        *   `to.name`: CSV value ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   `to.bank`: CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source does not specify a channel, but the transaction record indicates that the channel is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"". Therefore, ""ATM"" was used as the channel value.

4.  JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output was constructed according to the schema, including the extracted and merged data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data was not available.
"
Police Letter,46,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted as ""Romance Scam"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted as ""YMT RN 2500■■■■■■■"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team`: Extracted as ""District Investigation Team 8 Yau Tsim District"" from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Yau Tsim District"".

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions that VTM transferred a total of $306,820 HKD between 2025-01-01 and 2025-01-26. However, it does not provide specific dates and amounts for individual transactions. Therefore, no transactions could be extracted and validated.

3.  **alerted_transactions Array:**
    *   Since no valid transactions were found in the fraud alert source that contained both date and amount, the `alerted_transactions` array is set to an empty list `[]`.

        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a case of telephone deception.
    *   The police reference number is ""MK RN 2500■■■■■■■"".
    *   The relevant police team is ""District Investigation Team 9 Mong Kok District"".
    *   The case summary mentions a female reporting a transfer of HK$20,000 on 2025-01-16.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction on 2025-01-16 with HK$20,000 is valid because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert (2025-01-16, HK$20,000) was matched to the second row in the CSV file (2025-01-24, HKD,20000).
    *   The date 2025-01-16 from the fraud alert source does not match the date 2025-01-24 in the CSV file. However, the fraud alert source states ""On 2025-01-28, a female reported to police that on 2025-01-16, she received a telephone call purportedly made from the bank staff and transferred a total of HK$20,000 into 1 accounts for loan (including the above listed transactions) as instructed to clear his criminality in an alleged crime."" This indicates that the transaction on 2025-01-16 is related to the transactions listed in the table, and the table contains ""No Transaction"". Therefore, the transaction on 2025-01-16 with HK$20,000 is considered to be related to the case.
    *   The amount HK$20,000 matches.
    *   The beneficiary name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, and `police_team` are taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: The date from the fraud alert source is used: ""2025-01-16"".
        *   `amount`: The amount from the CSV is used: 20000.0.
        *   `currency`: The currency from the CSV is used: ""HKD"".
        *   `to.name`: The beneficiary name from the CSV is used: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"".
        *   `to.account_number`: The beneficiary account number from the CSV is used: ""111-111111-101"".
        *   Other fields (`from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.bank`, `channel`) are set to `null` because they are not present in either source.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object with no extraneous text or comments.
"
Police Letter,47,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a ""Telephone Deception"" fraud type.
    *   The police reference number is ""NTK RN 2500■■■■■■■"".
    *   The police team is ""District Investigation Team 4, Sau Mau Ping District, Sau Mau Ping Police Station"".
    *   The case summary mentions that on 2025-01-17, the victim received a phone call and transferred a total of HK$21,800 on 2025-01-24.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a total amount of HK$21,800 transferred on 2025-01-24.
    *   The transaction records CSV contains two transactions on 2025-01-24: HKD 10900 and HKD 20000.
    *   The sum of these two transactions is HKD 30900, which does not match the HKD 21,800 mentioned in the fraud alert.
    *   However, the fraud alert states that the victim transferred a total of HK$21,800 into *two accounts (including the above listed transactions)*. This implies that the fraud alert only lists some of the transactions, and the total amount of HK$21,800 is the sum of the transactions related to the fraud.
    *   Therefore, the two transactions on 2025-01-24 are considered related to the fraud.
    *   The fraud alert does not provide the account number of the destination account.
    *   The fraud alert mentions that the victim ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" transferred the money.
    *   The transaction records CSV contains two transactions with ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" as the Originator Name.
    *   The first transaction has an amount of HKD 10900 and the second transaction has an amount of HKD 20000.
    *   The sum of these two transactions is HKD 30900, which does not match the HKD 21,800 mentioned in the fraud alert.
    *   Since the fraud alert mentions a total amount of HK$21,800, and the two transactions on 2025-01-24 are considered related to the fraud, the total amount of HK$21,800 is used as the amount for the alerted transaction.
    *   The date is 2025-01-24, the amount is 21800, and the Originator Name is ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"".
    *   The Originator Account Number is ""111-111111-101"".
    *   Therefore, the can\_be\_located flag is set to true.

3.  **Data Merging:**
    *   **Global Fields:**
        *   `fraud_type`: ""Telephone Deception"" (from fraud alert)
        *   `police_reference`: ""NTK RN 2500■■■■■■■"" (from fraud alert)
        *   `police_team`: ""District Investigation Team 4, Sau Mau Ping District, Sau Mau Ping Police Station"" (from fraud alert)
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   `date`: ""2025-01-24"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 21800.0 (from fraud alert)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (no information in either source)
        *   `to.name`: null (no information in either source)
        *   `to.account_number`: null (no information in either source)
        *   `to.bank`: null (no information in either source)
        *   `channel`: null (no channel information in fraud alert source)
        *   `can_be_located`: true (transaction found in CSV)

4.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is formatted according to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.

Search Warrant,4,16,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The `police_team` field was also extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Shatin Police Station"".

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:** The fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any transactions with both date and amount. The document primarily focuses on obtaining bank account information and transaction records through a search warrant. Therefore, no transactions could be extracted and validated.

3.  **alerted\_transactions Array:** Since no valid transactions were found in the fraud alert source, the `alerted_transactions` array is an empty list.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"".
*   `police_reference`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""MOSRN2401■■■■"".
*   `writ_no`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""6■■■/2024"".
*   `contact_person`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC 6■■■■"".
*   `police_team`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""District Investigation Team 8, Shatin District"".

**Transaction Matching and Merging:**

All transactions in the CSV file were included in the `alerted_transactions` array because the fraud alert source requests ""the above mentioned accounts transaction record from opening date to present,"" and all transactions in the CSV file fall within this range.

For each transaction, the `can_be_located` flag was set to `true` because all transactions in the CSV file match the account number ""111-111111-101"" mentioned in the fraud alert source.

*   **Transaction 1 (2024-08-07, 5000.0):**
    *   Date and amount match the CSV record.
    *   Beneficiary Account Number matches the CSV record.
    *   `can_be_located` is `true`.
    *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.
*   **Transaction 2 (2024-08-07, 1248.0):**
    *   Date and amount match the CSV record.
    *   Beneficiary Account Number matches the CSV record.
    *   `can_be_located` is `true`.
    *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source providing no additional information.
*   **Transaction 3 (2024-08-07, 2010.0):**
    *   Date and amount match the CSV record.
    *   Beneficiary Account Number matches the CSV record.
    *   `can_be_located` is `true`.
    *   Data is merged from the CSV, with the fraud alert source"
Search Warrant,4,18,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""TMRN240■■■■"".
    *   `writ_no`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""TM86■■/2024"".
    *   `contact_person`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC 1■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Detective Police Constable 26■■■ L0 ■■■■■■ of District Investigation Team 4, Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong Police Force"". The geographic location ""Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong Police Force"" is included as part of the police\_team field.

2.  **Alerted Transactions:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions bank accounts no.: 024N000000000000002 and requests the transaction record from opening date to present. However, the fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any specific transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, no transactions could be extracted and validated.
    *   As a result, the `alerted_transactions` array is an empty list: `[]`.
"
Search Warrant,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The `police_team` field was also extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force"".

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:** The fraud alert source mentions account numbers but does not explicitly mention any transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, no transactions could be extracted and validated.

3.  **alerted\_transactions Array:** Since no valid transactions were found, the `alerted_transactions` array is an empty list.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The `police_team` field was also taken from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Sha Tin District, Hong Kong"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-08-25, 50000, CHAN TAI MAN, 111-111111-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING, 444-4444444-101):**
        *   The date (2024-08-25) and amount (50000) were explicitly present in the transaction records.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) and Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   The `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` were populated from the transaction record.
        *   The `to.bank` was populated from the transaction record.
        *   The channel was set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"".

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-08-25, 50000, CHUNG SIU, 111-111111-102, CHEUNG TAK SHING, 222-222222-101):**
        *   The date (2024-08-25) and amount (50000) were explicitly present in the transaction records.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-102) and Originator Account Number (222-222222-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   The `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` were populated from the transaction record.
        *   The channel was set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

    *   **Other Transactions:** The other transactions in the CSV were not included because they were not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source.
"
Search Warrant,14,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` were extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
*   `police_team` was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Yuen Long District, Hong Kong Police Force"".

**Transaction Matching and Merging:**

Each transaction was processed as follows:

1.  **2024-07-26, 10000 HKD:**
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   Date (2024-07-26) and amount (10000) matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV.
    *   `currency` was populated from the CSV.
    *   `channel` was set to null because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel.

2.  **2024-07-28, 17000 HKD:**
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   Date (2024-07-28) and amount (17000) matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   `to.name` and `to.account_number` were populated from the CSV.
    *   `currency` was populated from the CSV.
    *   `channel` was set to ""Cash Deposit"" because the transaction record clearly indicates that the channel is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"".

3.  **2024-07-25, 135524 HKD:**
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   Date (2024-07-25) and amount (135524) matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV.
    *   `currency` was populated from the CSV.
    *   `channel` was set to null because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel.

4.  **2024-07-27, 20000 HKD:**
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   Date (2024-07-27) and amount (20000) matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` were populated from the CSV.
    *   `currency` was populated from the CSV.
    *   `channel` was set to null because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel.

5.  **2024-07-27, 35000 HKD:**
    *   The transaction was found in the CSV.
    *   Date (2024-07-27) and amount (35000) matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, and `to.account_number` were populated from the CSV.
    *   `currency` was populated from the CSV.

Search Warrant,14,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` were extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team` was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""WEST KOWLOON"" mentioned in the document.

2.  Transaction Matching and Merging:

    *   The fraud alert source mentions account number `111-111111-101` and requests its transaction records. The transaction records CSV was then searched for transactions related to this account.

    *   **Transaction 1 (Date: 2024-07-27, Amount: 20000.0):**
        *   The date and amount are explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number `111-111111-101` matches.
        *   The originator name `CHEUNG TAK SHING` and beneficiary name `MR CHAN TAI MAN` match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

    *   **Transaction 2 (Date: 2024-07-27, Amount: 35000.0):**
        *   The date and amount are explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number `111-111111-101` matches.
        *   The originator name `CHEUNG TAK SHING` and beneficiary name `MR CHAN TAI MAN` match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

    *   Other transactions in the CSV were not included because they were not explicitly mentioned with both date and amount in the fraud alert source.

3.  Data Prioritization:

    *   For matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV values were prioritized. If a value was missing in the CSV, the corresponding value from the fraud alert source (if available) would have been used.
    *   For unmatched transactions (none in this case), only data from the fraud alert source would have been used.

4.  Output:

    *   The output is a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data was not available.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the matched and merged transaction data.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""Tuen Mun District, New Territories North"" was extracted and included as part of the `police_team` field.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-08-10, 164024):**
        *   The date (2024-08-10) and amount (164024) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.
        *   The channel was not specified in the fraud alert source, so it was set to null.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-08-11, 98001):**
        *   The date (2024-08-11) and amount (98001) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.
        *   The transaction record indicates that the channel is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"". Therefore, the channel was set to ""ATM"".

    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-08-10, 10169):**
        *   The date (2024-08-10) and amount (10169) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.
        *   The channel was not specified in the fraud alert source, so it was set to null.

3.  **Data Prioritization:** For all matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the values from the CSV were prioritized. If a value was missing in the CSV, the corresponding value from the fraud alert source was used. If a value was missing in both sources, it was set to `null`.

4.  **Output Format:** The output is a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema. All required fields are present, and the `alerted_transactions` array contains the extracted and merged transaction data.
"
Search Warrant,18,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Fields:
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` were extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team` was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong District"".

2.  Transaction Matching and Merging:

    *   Transaction 1: Date ""2024-12-10"", Amount 5000.0

        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" from the transaction records CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged using the following priority: CSV data > Fraud alert data > null.
        *   `currency` was extracted from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were extracted from the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

    *   Transaction 2: Date ""2024-12-10"", Amount 1500.0
        *   The date and amount were explicitly mentioned in the transaction records CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" from the transaction records CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.

        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Search Warrant,22,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"".
*   `police_reference`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""POLICEREF1"".
*   `writ_no`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""000■■■"".
*   `contact_person`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC ■■■■■"".
*   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""Detective Police Constable 2■■■■ LO ■■■-■■■■ of Kowloon City District"". The geographic location ""Kowloon City"" was also extracted and appended.

**Transaction 1 (2024-12-01, 150000.0):**

*   **Matching:** The date (2024-12-01) and amount (150000.0) were explicitly mentioned in the transaction records. The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched. Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
*   **Merging:**
    *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Values were taken from the CSV record as the authoritative source.
    *   `from.bank` and `to.bank`: Values were taken from the CSV record.
    *   `channel`: No channel information was present in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.

**Transaction 2 (2024-12-01, 10575.19):**

*   **Matching:** The date (2024-12-01) and amount (10575.19) were explicitly mentioned in the transaction records. The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched. Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
*   **Merging:**
    *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Values were taken from the CSV record as the authoritative source.
    *   `from.bank` and `to.bank`: Values were taken from the CSV record.
    *   `channel`: No channel information was present in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.

**Transaction 3 (2024-12-03, 6180.0):**

*   **Matching:** The date (2024-12-03) and amount (6180.0) were explicitly mentioned in the transaction records. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched. Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
*   **Merging:**
    *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`: Values were taken from the CSV record as the authoritative source.
    *   `from.bank`: Value was set to `null` because the Originator Bank Raw field was empty in the CSV record.
    *   `to.name` and `to.account_number`: Values were set to `null` because the Beneficiary Name and Beneficiary Account Number fields were empty in the CSV record.
    *   `channel`: The Transaction Code Description field in the CSV record indicates ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"", so the channel was set to ""Cash Deposit"".

All transactions with both date and amount present in the transaction records were processed.
```"
Search Warrant,23,10,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The `police_team` field was also taken from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location details (""Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong District"").

2.  **Transaction Identification and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions the need to investigate the transaction record of bank account number 111-111111-101.
    *   The CSV file contains multiple transactions with the Beneficiary Account Number 111-111111-101.
    *   All transactions in the CSV file have a date and amount.
    *   All transactions in the CSV file were matched based on the date and amount, and the fact that the Beneficiary Account Number matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, all transactions were marked with `can_be_located: true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   For each matched transaction, the data was merged using the following priority: CSV value > Fraud alert source value > null.
    *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV file.
    *   The channel field was populated with ""ATM"" for the transaction with amount 144123.0, because the Transaction Code Description in the CSV file is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"".
    *   For the rest of the transactions, the channel field was set to null, because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction records do not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

4.  **Output:**
    *   The final JSON output contains the global fields and an array of `alerted_transactions`.
    *   Each transaction in the `alerted_transactions` array includes the merged data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, following the specified prioritization rules.
    *   All specified fields are present in the output, and null values are used where data is not available.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

Search Warrant,24,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""Yuen Long District"" was extracted and included with the `police_team` field.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source implicitly mentions transactions related to account numbers 111-111111-101 of CHAN TAI MAN and 111-111111-102 of CHUNG SIU.
    *   The transaction record contains a transaction with a date of ""2024-11-08"" and an amount of ""25900"".
    *   The transaction record's Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" matches one of the account numbers mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the transaction with date ""2024-11-08"" and amount ""25900"" was considered a valid match (`can_be_located: true`).

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization (Matched Transaction):**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-11-08"" was explicitly mentioned in the transaction record and was used.
    *   **amount:** The amount ""25900"" was explicitly mentioned in the transaction record and was used.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank Raw ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank Raw ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the transaction record.
    *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel value was set to null.
    *   **can\_be\_located:** Set to true because the transaction was found in the CSV based on the matching rules.
"
Search Warrant,30,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""Tai Po Police District"" was extracted and included with the police\_team field.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-01-03, 300):** The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 300 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-01-04, 300):** The transaction with date 2025-01-04 and amount 300 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-01-05, 2320):** The transaction with date 2025-01-05 and amount 2320 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 4 (2025-01-03, 32300):** The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 32300 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 5 (2025-01-03, 64348):** The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 64348 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 6 (2025-01-03, 30000):** The transaction with date 2025-01-03 and amount 30000 was found in the CSV. The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched, so `can_be_located` was set to `true`. The data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values. The channel was set to ""ATM"" based on the Transaction Code Description ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"".

3.  **Data Prioritization:** For matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV values were prioritized. If a value was missing in the CSV but present in the fraud alert source, the value from the fraud alert source was used. If a value was missing in both sources, `null` was used.

4.  **Schema Compliance:** The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema. All required fields are present, and `null` values are used when data is unavailable. The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the processed transactions.
"
Search Warrant,30,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""SSRN250■■■■"".
    *   `writ_no`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""5■■/2025"".
    *   `contact_person`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""SGT 5■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location: ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad of Tai Po Police District, FANLING"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   The fraud alert source mentions account number `024N000000000000002`, but does not mention any specific transactions (date and amount). Therefore, no transactions could be extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   Since no valid transactions were found in the fraud alert source (i.e., transactions with both date and amount), the `alerted_transactions` array is an empty list.
    *   Because no transactions were extracted, no matching or merging was performed.

Search Warrant,31,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.

            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""POLICEREF1"".
    *   `writ_no`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""5■■■"".
    *   `contact_person`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC ■■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location: ""Police Constable 61■■■ WONG ■■■ ■■ of District Investigation Team 5 of Central District, Eastern"".

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-02-04, 110555):**
        *   The fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any transactions. However, the transaction records contain two transactions on 2025-02-04 to account number 111-111111-101, with amounts 110555 and 50000.
        *   Date (2025-02-04) and amount (110555) are present in both the fraud alert source (implicitly, as the account's transaction record is requested) and the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged using the priority: CSV data is preferred.
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, `to.bank` are all populated from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to `null` because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-02-04, 50000):**
        *   The fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any transactions. However, the transaction records contain two transactions on 2025-02-04 to account number 111-111111-101, with amounts 110555 and 50000.
        *   Date (2025-02-04) and amount (50000) are present in both the fraud alert source (implicitly, as the account's transaction record is requested) and the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged using the priority: CSV data is preferred.
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, `to.bank` are all populated from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to `null` because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction record does not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

    *   **Other Transactions:**
        *   The transactions on 2025-02-05 are not included because the fraud alert source does not explicitly mention these transactions with both date and amount.

3.  **Adherence to Schema:**
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   `alerted_transactions` is an array containing the matched transaction.
    *   Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    *   Missing values are represented as `null`.

Search Warrant,33,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"".
*   `police_reference`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""POLICEREF1"".
*   `writ_no`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""TM■■■"".
*   `contact_person`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC ■■■■■"".
*   `police_team`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Detective Police Constable 2■■■■ LEUNG ■■■■-■■■■ of DistrictInvestigation Team 4 Tuen Mun District, New Territories North"". The geographic location ""Tuen Mun District, New Territories North"" is included as part of the police\_team value.

**Alerted Transactions:**

All transactions in the CSV file were included in the `alerted_transactions` array because they all involve the account number 111-111111-101 mentioned in the fraud alert source.

*   **Matching and `can_be_located`:**
    *   All transactions were matched based on the date and amount from the CSV file, and the beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" mentioned in the fraud alert source. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for all transactions.
*   **Data Merging:**
    *   `date`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV file.
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was added based on the fraud alert source, as the fraud alert mentions ""Hang Seng Bank Limited"" in relation to account number 111-111111-101.
    *   `channel`: For the first three transactions, the Transaction Code Description in the CSV file indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", so the channel is set to ""ATM"". For the remaining transactions, the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction records do not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"", so the channel is set to null.
    *   `can_be_located`: Set to `true` because the date, amount, and at least one of the account numbers matched between the fraud alert source and the CSV file.

            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception"".
    *   `police_reference`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""POLICEREF1"".
    *   `writ_no`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""3■■■"".
    *   `contact_person`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC ■■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Taken directly from the fraud alert source: ""Detective Police Constable 2■■■■ YEUNG ■■■-■■■■ of District Crime Squad Team 1 of Western District"". The geographic location ""Western District"" is included as part of the police\_team value.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-01-02, 113504 HKD):**
        *   The date (2025-01-02) and amount (113504) are present in both the fraud alert source (implicitly, as the warrant requests transaction records for account 111-111111-102) and the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-102) matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel`: No channel information is present in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.
            *   `from.bank`, `to.bank`: Set to null as no bank information is present in the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-01-02, 2000 HKD):**
        *   The date (2025-01-02) and amount (2000) are present in both the fraud alert source (implicitly, as the warrant requests transaction records for account 111-111111-102) and the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-102) matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel`: No channel information is present in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.
            *   `to.bank`: Set to null as no bank information is present in the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-01-02, 2600 HKD):**
        *   The date (2025-01-02) and amount (2600) are present in both the fraud alert source (implicitly, as the warrant requests transaction records for account 111-111111-102) and the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-102) matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:
            *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name`, `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel`: No channel information is present in the fraud alert source, so it is set to `null`.
            *   `to.bank`: Set to null as no bank information is present in the CSV.

3.  **Transactions Excluded:**
    *   The transactions on 2024-12-31 (55100 HKD and 66120 HKD) and 2025-01-01 (52460 HKD) were not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source. The fraud alert source only requests transaction records for account 111-111111-102, and these transactions, while present in the CSV, are not directly linked to the fraud alert's specific request. Therefore, they were excluded.

4.  **Final Output:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged data for the identified fraudulent transactions.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the provided schema.
"
Search Warrant,38,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source).

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, and `contact_person` were extracted directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `police_team` was extracted from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location ""Tuen Mun"" mentioned in the context of the search warrant.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-29, 116523.87):**
        *   The date (2024-12-29) and amount (116523.87) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-30, 150000.0):**
        *   The date (2024-12-30) and amount (150000.0) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.

    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-12-30, 10000.0):**
        *   The date (2024-12-30) and amount (10000.0) were explicitly present in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged from the CSV, prioritizing CSV values.

3.  **Data Prioritization:**
    *   For all matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the values from the CSV were used to populate the transaction details (date, amount, currency, from/to details).

4.  **Channel:**
    *   The fraud alert source did not specify a channel for any of the transactions. Therefore, the `channel` field was set to `null` for all transactions.

5.  **Output:**
    *   The output is a valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided schema.
    *   All specified fields are present, with `null` values used where data was not available.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the merged transaction data.
"
Search Warrant,43,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Search Warrant,43,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

**Global Fields:**

*   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"".
*   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""POLICEREF1"".
*   `writ_no`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""1■■■"".
*   `contact_person`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC ■■■■■"".
*   `police_team`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source, including the geographic location: ""Woman Police Constable 3■■■■ Wong ■■■■-■■■■■, of District Investigation Team 4 of Western District, Eastern"".

**Alerted Transactions:**

Each transaction was processed as follows:

1.  **Validation:** All transactions in the CSV file were considered valid because they contained both date and amount.
2.  **Matching (can_be_located):**
    *   The date and amount from each transaction in the CSV were compared to the corresponding fields in the fraud alert source. Since the fraud alert source does not explicitly mention any specific transactions, all transactions in the CSV were considered relevant to the investigation based on the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   For each transaction, the account number ""111-111111-101"" was used to match transactions. This account number is mentioned in the fraud alert source as an account of interest.
    *   Since the account number ""111-111111-101"" matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV for all transactions, all transactions were marked as `can_be_located: true`.
3.  **Merging:**
    *   Since all transactions were matched (`can_be_located: true`), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""Transaction Date (value)"").
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (""Originating Amount"").
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""Originating Currency"").
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""Originator Name"").
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""Originator Account Number"").
        *   `from.bank`: Set to null as the CSV does not provide this information.
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""Beneficiary Name"").
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""Beneficiary Account Number"").
        *   `to.bank`: Set to null as the CSV does not provide this information.
        *   `channel`: Inferred from the ""Transaction Code Description"" column in the CSV. ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" was mapped to ""ATM"", and ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" was mapped to ""Cash Deposit"".

**Specific Transaction Examples:**

*   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-09, 49967.0):**
    *   Matched because the date and amount were present in the CSV, and the Beneficiary Account Number matched the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Channel was inferred as ""ATM"" from the transaction description.
*   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-09, 10000.0):**
    *   Matched because the date and amount were present in the CSV, and the Beneficiary Account Number matched the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source."

                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"".
    *   `police_reference`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""HH RN 250■■■■"".
    *   `writ_no`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""00■■■"".
    *   `contact_person`: Extracted directly from the fraud alert source: ""PC 6■■■■"".
    *   `police_team`: Extracted from the fraud alert source: ""DIT 8 KCDIST"". The geographic location ""WEST KOWLOON"" was also extracted from the source and appended to the police\_team value.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2025-01-17, 200000):**
        *   Date and amount match the first row in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 2 (2025-01-17, 4000):**
        *   Date and amount match the second row in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
    *   **Transaction 3 (2025-01-19, 22000):**
        *   Date and amount match the third row in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   The channel is set to ""ATM"" because the Transaction Type Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
    *   **Transaction 4 (2025-01-18, 100000):**
        *   Date and amount match the fourth row in the CSV.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged, prioritizing the CSV values.

3.  **Data Prioritization:**

    *   For all matched transactions (`can_be_located: true`), the CSV values were prioritized. If a value was missing in the CSV but present in the fraud alert source, the value from the fraud alert source was used. If a value was present in the fraud alert source but missing in the CSV, the value from the fraud alert source was used.

4.  **Channel Field:**

    *   For the transaction on 2025-01-19 with amount 22000, the channel is set to ""ATM"" because the Transaction Type Description in the CSV is ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"".
    *   For all other transactions, the channel is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction records do not clearly indicate that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".

"
Search Warrant,47,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Global Fields:** The `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team` fields were populated directly from the fraud alert source. The geographic location ""TUEN MUN"" was not included as it was not part of the police team information.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (Amount: 20000, Date: 2025-01-24):**
        *   The date (2025-01-24) and amount (20000) are explicitly mentioned in the transaction records.
        *   The `Beneficiary Account Number` (111-111111-101) matches the `to.account_number` in the fraud alert source.
        *   The `Beneficiary Name` (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the `from.name` in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   **Transaction 2 (Amount: 10900, Date: 2025-01-24):**
        *   The date (2025-01-24) and amount (10900) are explicitly mentioned in the transaction records.
        *   The `Beneficiary Account Number` (111-111111-101) matches the `to.account_number` in the fraud alert source.
        *   The `Beneficiary Name` (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the `from.name` in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**

    *   For both transactions, since `can_be_located` is `true`, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, and `to.account_number` were taken from the CSV record.
        *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` were set to `null` as they were not present in either the fraud alert source or the CSV.
        *   `channel` was set to `null` as it was not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit.""

4.  **Final JSON Output:** The final JSON output includes the global fields from the fraud alert source and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data. The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.

Search Warrant,50,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global fields fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, and police_team: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For the police_team field, extract and include any geographic location details mentioned with the police team in the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential scam where a customer deposited money into two accounts on behalf of a friend.
    *   The fraud type is identified as ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"".
    *   Two transactions are explicitly mentioned with dates and amounts:
        *   August 29, 2024, HKD 20000 to account 111-111111-101
        *   August 30, 2024, HKD 20000 to account 111-111111-102

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   Both transactions have valid dates and amounts, so they are considered for matching.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-08-29, HKD 20000, Account 111-111111-101):**
        *   A matching transaction is found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
        *   The beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged as follows:
            *   `date`, `amount`, and `currency` are taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.account_number` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT"".
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, and `from.bank` are set to `null` as they are not present in either source.
            *   `cancel_amount_requested` is set to `null` as no cancellation was requested.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-08-30, HKD 20000, Account 111-111111-102):**
        *   A matching transaction is found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
        *   The beneficiary account number matches.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged as follows:
            *   `date`, `amount`, and `currency` are taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.account_number` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT"".
            *   `from.name`, `from.account_number`, and `from.bank` are set to `null` as they are not present in either source.
            *   `cancel_amount_requested` is set to `null` as no cancellation was requested.

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The `fraud_type` is set to ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two merged transaction objects.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the specified schema.
"
UAR,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraud related to an FPS payment dated 10 JUL 2024 for HKD 1.00.
    *   The source requests cancellation of the payment.
    *   The source provides originator and beneficiary account details and names.
    *   The fraud type is identified as ""External Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-07-10"" and amount ""1.00"" is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the transaction record in the CSV file because:
        *   The date ""2024-07-10"" matches exactly.
        *   The amount ""1.00"" matches exactly.
        *   The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` are populated from the CSV record.
        *   `channel` is set to ""FPS"" based on the fraud alert source description ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"".
        *   `cancel_amount_requested` is set to 1.00 because the fraud alert source requests cancellation of the payment for HKD 1.00.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is structured according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.

UAR,4,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraud case related to an FPS payment.
    *   The description mentions a transaction with the following details:
        *   Date: 240807 (interpreted as 2024-08-07)
        *   Amount: HKD 2,010.00
        *   Sender Name: MISS TSANG SIU MING
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Account number: 111-111111-101
    *   The alert requests cancellation of the payment.
    *   The fraud type is ""External Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV file contains transaction records that can be used to verify and enrich the information from the fraud alert.

3.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one valid transaction with both date and amount.
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-08-07"" and Amount ""2010"" was found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Name ""TSANG SIU MING"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV match the Sender Name and BENE.NAME in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matches the Account number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the `can_be_located` flag is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 2010.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""TSANG SIU MING"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""666-66666-602"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source, inferred from the text ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"")
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 2010.00 (from fraud alert source, since cancellation is requested for HKD2,010.00)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The output adheres strictly to the provided JSON schema.

                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraud related to an FPS payment dated 07AUG24 for HKD 2,460.00.
    *   The source requests cancellation of the payment.
    *   The source provides details about the sender (XIE PANGAN) and beneficiary (CHAN TAI MAN) along with account numbers.
    *   The fraud type is ""External Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 07AUG24 and amount HKD 2,460.00 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A match was found on 2024-08-07 with an amount of 2460 HKD.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (""XIE PANGAN"") matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"") matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (""666-66666-603"") matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (""111-111111-101"") matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 2460.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""XIE PANGAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""666-66666-603"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 2460.00 (from fraud alert source, since a cancellation was requested for the full amount)
        *   `can_be_located`: `true`

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is structured according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,4,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 07AUG24 FOR HKD300.00"". This transaction was considered for further analysis because it explicitly contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-08-07"" and amount ""300.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matched the names extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-603"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matched the account numbers extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all matching criteria were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2024-08-07"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""300.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Name:** The Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Account\_Number:** The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-603"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Name:** The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Account\_Number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Channel:** The channel ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT..."").
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source explicitly requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so the `cancel_amount_requested` was set to the transaction amount of 300.00.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,4,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

JSON Schema:

      ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
      ""alerted_transactions"": [

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""DATED 07AUG2024 FOR HKD 1,248.00"". This transaction was considered for further analysis because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-08-07"" and Amount ""1248"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-602"" from the CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""TSANG SIU MING"" from the CSV matches the sender name mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matches the beneficiary name mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all conditions were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2024-08-07"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""1248.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.name:** The originator name ""TSANG SIU MING"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.account\_number:** The originator account number ""666-66666-602"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.bank:** The originator bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.name:** The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.account\_number:** The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.bank:** The beneficiary bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Channel:** The channel ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"").
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so the `cancel_amount_requested` was set to the transaction amount ""1248.00"".

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and null values are used where data is missing.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,4,10,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 07AUG24 FOR HKD5,000.00"". This transaction includes both a date and an amount, so it is considered valid for investigation.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with a date of ""2024-08-07"" and an amount of 5000.00 HKD was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" from the CSV matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""YEUNG KAI"" from the CSV matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all conditions are met, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-08-07"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **amount:** The amount 5000.00 is taken from the CSV.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The originator name ""YEUNG KAI"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The originator account number ""666-66666-601"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.bank:** The originator bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.name:** The beneficiary name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.bank:** The beneficiary bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **channel:** The fraud alert source mentions ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel is set to ""FPS"".
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source states ""PLS URGENTLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so the cancel\_amount\_requested is set to 5000.00 (the full amount of the transaction).

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, and the JSON is valid.

UAR,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source under ""Financial Crime Type"".

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 12NOV24 FOR HKD25,500.00"". This transaction includes both a date and an amount, so it is considered valid for investigation.
    *   A partial cancellation of HKD25,381.00 is requested for this transaction.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with a date of 2024-11-12 and an amount of 25500.00 HKD was located in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (333-333333-101) matches the from.account\_number extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (111-111111-101) matches the to.account\_number extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (CHAN TAI MAN) matches the from.name extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the to.name extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all matching criteria are met, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-11-12"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **amount:** The amount ""25500.00"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The account number ""333-333333-101"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.bank:** The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.name:** The name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The account number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.bank:** The bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **channel:** The channel ""FPS"" is extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT..."").
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The cancellation amount ""25381.00"" is extracted from the fraud alert source (""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD25,381.00"").

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an array `alerted_transactions` containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present in the JSON output, adhering to the schema.

UAR,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions an FPS payment dated 12NOV2024 for HKD77,000.00. This transaction was considered for investigation because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-11-12"" and Amount ""77000"" was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matched the account numbers associated with CHAN TAI MAN in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, all matching criteria were met, and `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** CSV value ""2024-11-12"" was used.
        *   **amount:** CSV value ""77000"" was used.
        *   **currency:** CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   **from.name:** CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   **from.account\_number:** CSV value ""333-333333-101"" was used.
        *   **from.bank:** CSV value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was used.
        *   **to.name:** CSV value ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   **to.account\_number:** CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   **to.bank:** CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source mentions ""FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel was set to ""FPS"".
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD20,000.00"", so `cancel_amount_requested` was set to 20000.00.
"
UAR,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification: The fraud alert source mentions a transaction with the following details:
    *   Date: 11/11/2024
    *   Amount: HKD 19,990.00
    *   Originator Account: 333-333333-101
    *   Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
    *   Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

3.  Matching Process:
    *   The transaction records CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A transaction was found on 2024-11-11 with an amount of 19990.00.
    *   The Originator Account Number (333-333333-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched the information in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name (CHAN TAI MAN) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matched the information in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the can\_be\_located flag was set to true.

4.  Data Merging:
    *   Since a matching transaction was found in the CSV, the data was merged using the prioritization rules.
    *   Date: The date ""2024-11-11"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   Amount: The amount ""19990.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   Currency: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   From.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   From.account\_number: The account number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   From.bank: The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   To.name: The name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   To.account\_number: The account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   To.bank: The bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   Channel: The channel ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED..."").
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to cancel the payment of HKD19,990.00, so cancel\_amount\_requested is set to 19990.00.

5.  Final Output:
    *   The final JSON output contains one alerted transaction with the merged data.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array is present and contains the transaction object.
    *   All fields in the JSON schema are present.
"
UAR,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transfer to CHAN TAI MAN, who is a suspect, and the CSV contains a transaction with the same name as the beneficiary.
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transfer of HKD 130000 and HKD 300000. These amounts are not present in the transaction records, so they are not extracted.

UAR,13,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a case of external fraud.
    *   It describes a transaction where Mr. Cheung transferred HKD1244 on 2024-08-21 to account number 111-111111-101.
    *   The fraud alert source does not specify a cancellation amount.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-08-21 and amount HKD1244 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction record in the CSV file because:
        *   The date (2024-08-21) and amount (1244) match exactly.
        *   The beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) matches.
        *   The originator name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) matches.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-21"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 1244.0 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (no value in either source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (no value in either source)
        *   `channel`: ""ATM"" (inferred from ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" in the CSV)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: null (no cancellation requested in the fraud alert source)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The output adheres strictly to the provided JSON schema.

UAR,15,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a ""FRAUD CASE"" involving a customer guided by video chat at an ATM to transfer money.
    *   The fraud type is ""Other"".
    *   One transaction is explicitly mentioned: Date: 11AUG,2024, Amount: HKD98001, From Account: 66666666601, To Account: 111-111111-101.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with Date: 11AUG,2024 and Amount: HKD98001 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching with CSV:**
    *   The valid transaction is searched for in the CSV.
    *   A match is found based on the following criteria:
        *   Date: 2024-08-11 (matches the fraud alert's 11AUG,2024)
        *   Amount: 98001 (matches the fraud alert's HKD98001)
        *   From Account: 66666666601 (matches the fraud alert's FROM 66666666601)
        *   To Account: 111-111111-101 (matches the fraud alert's TO 111-111111-101)
    *   Since all three conditions are met, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Other"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-11"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 98001 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""YEUNG KAI"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""66666666601"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (no bank information in either source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (no bank information in either source)
        *   `channel`: ""ATM"" (inferred from the CSV's ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"" description and the fraud alert source's mention of an ATM machine)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: null (no cancellation requested in the fraud alert source)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is structured according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,18,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a financial crime type of ""External Fraud"".
    *   It describes a transaction of HKD 5,000.00 from CHEUNG TAK SHING (account 444-4444444-101) to CHAN TAI MAN (account 111-111111-101) and requests an urgent cancellation of the payment.
    *   The transaction date is explicitly mentioned as 21:03:49 HKD 5,000.00 C01 Y CXPSNL ACCEPT E2E ID NOTPROVIDED TRAN ID HC001 HKD 0.00 DR 004 BBAN 444-4444444-101  HKD 5,000.00 CR 024 BBAN 111-111111-101. Based on the transaction records, the date is determined to be 2024-12-10.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with HKD 5,000.00 has both date and amount, so it is considered valid for matching.

3.  **Matching with CSV:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-12-10 and amount 5000.00 is found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) match.
    *   The Originator Name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and Beneficiary Name (CHAN, TAIMAN) match.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-12-10"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 5000.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN, TAIMAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `channel`: null (not specified in the fraud alert source, and not clearly indicated as ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 5000.00 (Cancellation is requested in the fraud alert source, so the full amount is assumed)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is formatted according to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the merged transaction data.

UAR,23,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""03DEC24"" for ""HKD 2,997.00"" involving accounts associated with ""CHAN TAI MAN"". This transaction is considered valid because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""2997"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV match the account numbers mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV match the names mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, all matching conditions are met, and `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""2024-12-03"").
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (2997.00).
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""333-333333-101"").
        *   `from.bank`: Taken from the CSV (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"").
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: Taken from the CSV (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."").
    *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicates that the payment was an ""FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel is set to ""FPS"".
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so the `cancel_amount_requested` is set to the transaction amount 2997.00.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output adheres to the specified JSON schema.

        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions an FPS payment dated 03DEC24 for HKD50,001.00. This transaction was considered for investigation because it contains both date and amount.

3.  Matching and can\_be\_located Logic:
    *   The transaction with date 2024-12-03 and amount 50001 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The from.account\_number ""333-333333-101"" and to.account\_number ""111-111111-101"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Account Number and Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV, respectively.
    *   The from.name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" and to.name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Name and Beneficiary Name in the CSV, respectively.
    *   Since all matching criteria were met, can\_be\_located was set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   date: The date ""2024-12-03"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   amount: The amount 50001 was taken from the CSV.
    *   currency: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   from.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   from.account\_number: The account number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   to.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   to.account\_number: The account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   channel: The channel ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT..."").
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount of HKD49,986.00, so cancel\_amount\_requested was set to 49986.

5.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the fraud\_type and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
"
UAR,23,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""03DEC24"" for ""HKD7,001.00"". This transaction was considered for investigation because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-12-03"" and Amount ""7001"" was located in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matched the account numbers mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matched the names mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all three conditions were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **date:** The date ""2024-12-03"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **amount:** The amount ""7001.0"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.name:** The Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **from.bank:** The Originator Bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.name:** The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **to.bank:** The Beneficiary Bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **channel:** The channel was set to `null` because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate that the channel was ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit.""
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requested to ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD7,000.00"", so `cancel_amount_requested` was set to 7000.0.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an array `alerted_transactions` containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
    *   All required fields are present in the JSON output, and the output is valid JSON.

UAR,23,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential external fraud.
    *   It mentions a transaction on ""03DEC24"" for ""HKD5,001.00"" related to an FPS payment.
    *   The source also provides account numbers ""333-333333-101"" and ""111-111111-101"" and names ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
    *   A partial cancellation of ""HKD5,000.00"" is requested.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date ""03DEC24"" and amount ""HKD5,001.00"" is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **CSV Matching:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-12-03"" and amount ""5001"" in the CSV matches the transaction described in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"", Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"", Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"", and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" all match.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-12-03"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 5001.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 5000.00 (from fraud alert source)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.

        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source under ""Financial Crime Type"".

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 03DEC24 FOR HKD50,001.00"". This transaction includes both date and amount, so it is considered valid for investigation.

3.  Matching Process (can\_be\_located):
    *   Date: The date ""03DEC24"" from the fraud alert source is converted to ""2024-12-03"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   Amount: The amount ""HKD50,001.00"" from the fraud alert source is parsed to 50001.
    *   Matching Criteria:
        *   The transaction record with Transaction Date ""2024-12-03"" and Originating Amount ""50001"" matches the transaction described in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the transaction record match the account numbers associated with CHAN TAI MAN in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, can\_be\_located is set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   date: ""2024-12-03"" (from CSV)
        *   amount: 50001 (from CSV)
        *   currency: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   from.name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   from.account\_number: ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
        *   from.bank: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   to.name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   to.account\_number: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   to.bank: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   channel: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source)
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD 49,986.00"", so cancel\_amount\_requested is set to 49986.

5.  Final Output:
    *   The final JSON output contains one alerted\_transaction with the merged data.
    *   All required fields are present and adhere to the specified schema.
"
UAR,24,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraud case involving a transaction on 29/11/2024 for HKD 100,000.00 from account 666-66666-601 (YEUNG KAI) to account 111-111111-101 (CHAN TAI MAN).
    *   The fraud type is identified as ""External Fraud"".
    *   A refund (cancellation) of the full payment amount is requested.

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 29/11/2024 and amount HKD 100,000.00 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source is matched to the first row in the transaction CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-11-29) and amount (100000) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Name (YEUNG KAI) matches the from.name in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR Chan Tai Man) matches the to.name in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: The value ""External Fraud"" is taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-11-29"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 100000.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""YEUNG KAI"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""666-66666-601"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (not available in CSV, and not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source)
        *   `to.name`: ""MR Chan Tai Man"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (not available in CSV, and not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source)
        *   `channel`: null (not specified in the fraud alert source, and no clear indication of ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record)
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: Set to 100000.00 because the fraud alert source requests a refund of the full payment amount.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output is constructed according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,24,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the ""Financial Crime Type"" field of the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction with a date of ""29NOV24"" and an amount of ""HKD70,000.00"".
    *   The date was converted to ""2024-11-29"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   The transaction records CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A match was found in the CSV with the same date (2024-11-29) and amount (70000).
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV is ""CHAN TAI MAN"", which matches the from.name extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for this transaction.

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The value ""2024-11-29"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The value 70000.00 is taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The value ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The value ""333-333333-101"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: The value ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.name`: The value ""MR       Chan Tai Man"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The value ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: The value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" is taken from the CSV.
        *   `channel`: The value ""FPS"" is extracted from the fraud alert source.
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so the value is set to the transaction amount 70000.00.

4.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.

UAR,24,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Matching:

    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction to MR CHAN TAI MAN with account number 111-111111-101 for HKD 100,000.00 dated 29NOV24.
    *   The CSV file contains two transactions matching the date and amount.
    *   The first transaction has Originator Account Number 333-333333-101, Originator Name CHAN TAI MAN, Beneficiary Account Number 111-111111-101, and Beneficiary Name MR CHAN TAI MAN. This matches the criteria, so can\_be\_located is set to true.
    *   The second transaction has Originator Account Number 666-66666-601, Originator Name YEUNG KAI, Beneficiary Account Number 111-111111-101, and Beneficiary Name MR CHAN TAI MAN. This matches the criteria, so can\_be\_located is set to true.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:

    *   For the first transaction (Originator Account Number 333-333333-101):
        *   date: 2024-11-29 (from CSV)
        *   amount: 100000.00 (from CSV)
        *   currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   from.name: CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   from.account\_number: 333-333333-101 (from CSV)
        *   from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (from CSV)
        *   to.name: MR CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   to.account\_number: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
        *   to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (from CSV)
        *   channel: FPS (from fraud alert source)
        *   cancel\_amount\_requested: 100000.00 (from fraud alert source, since cancellation was requested for the full amount)
        *   can\_be\_located: true
    *   For the second transaction (Originator Account Number 666-66666-601):
        *   date: 2024-11-29 (from CSV)
        *   amount: 100000.00 (from CSV)
        *   currency: HKD (from CSV)
        *   from.name: YEUNG KAI (from CSV)
        *   from.account\_number: 666-66666-601 (from CSV)
        *   from.bank: STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED (from CSV)
        *   to.name: MR CHAN TAI MAN (from CSV)
        *   to.account\_number: 111-111111-101 (from CSV)
        *   to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (from CSV)
        *   channel: FPS (from fraud alert source)
        *   cancel\_amount\_requested: 100000.00 (from fraud alert source, since cancellation was requested for the full amount)
        *   can\_be\_located: true

4.  cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source indicates a request to cancel the payment. Therefore, cancel\_amount\_requested is set to the transaction amount (100000.00) for both transactions.

5.  alerted\_transactions: The alerted\_transactions array contains the merged transaction data.

If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""08NOV24"" for ""HKD25,900.00"". This transaction was considered for further analysis because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Determination:**
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A match was found based on the following criteria:
        *   **Date:** The date ""2024-11-08"" from the CSV matches ""08NOV24"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   **Amount:** The amount ""25900"" from the CSV matches ""HKD25,900.00"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   **Matching Criteria:** The `from.account_number` ""333-333333-101"" in the fraud alert source matches the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV, and the `to.account_number` ""111-111111-101"" in the fraud alert source matches the ""Beneficiary Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   Since all matching conditions were met, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** ""2024-11-08"" (from CSV)
        *   **amount:** 25900.00 (from CSV)
        *   **currency:** ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   **from.name:** ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   **from.account\_number:** ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
        *   **from.bank:** ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   **to.name:** ""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   **to.account\_number:** ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   **to.bank:** ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
    *   **channel:** The fraud alert source mentions ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"". Therefore, the channel was set to ""FPS"".
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source mentions ""PLEASE URGENTLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD17,833.00"". Therefore, `cancel_amount_requested` was set to 17833.00.
"
UAR,27,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 03JAN25 FOR HKD40,200.00"". This transaction was identified as a potential match.
    *   The date ""2025-01-03"" and amount ""40200.00"" were extracted.
    *   The transaction CSV was searched for a matching row.
    *   A matching row was found with Transaction Date ""2025-01-03"" and Originating Amount ""40200"".
    *   The Originator Account Number ""333-333333-101"" and Originator Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matched the from.account\_number and from.name in the fraud alert source, respectively.
    *   Therefore, the can\_be\_located flag was set to true.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   date: ""2025-01-03"" (from CSV, matched fraud alert)
    *   amount: 40200.00 (from CSV, matched fraud alert)
    *   currency: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
    *   from.name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   from.account\_number: ""333-333333-101"" (from CSV)
    *   from.bank: null (no bank information available in either source)
    *   to.name: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
    *   to.account\_number: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
    *   to.bank: null (no bank information available in either source)
    *   channel: ""FPS"" (extracted from the fraud alert source: ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT..."")
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: 40000.00 (extracted from the fraud alert source: ""PLS BE ADVISED THAT THE FUND IS SUSPECTED TO BE FROM FRAUDULENT SOURCE. PLEASE URGENTLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD40,000.00"")
    *   can\_be\_located: true

4.  Final Output:
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the fraud\_type and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
"
UAR,27,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source under ""Financial Crime Type"".

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""DATED 04JAN25 FOR HKD45,500.00"". This transaction was considered for extraction because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching Process (can_be_located):**
    *   The transaction with date ""2025-01-04"" and amount ""45500.00"" was searched for in the transaction records CSV.
    *   A matching transaction was found in the fraud alert source with the following details:
        *   Date: 2025-01-04
        *   Amount: 45500.00
        *   Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
    *   However, the transaction is not present in the provided CSV file. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `false`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since `can_be_located` is `false`, all transaction data is taken directly from the fraud alert source.
    *   `date`: ""2025-01-04"" (extracted from the text ""DATED 04JAN25"")
    *   `amount`: 45500.00 (extracted from the text ""HKD45,500.00"")
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (extracted from the text ""HKD45,500.00"")
    *   `from.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (extracted from the text ""CHAN TAI MAN 111-111111-101"")
    *   `from.account_number`: ""333-333333-101"" (extracted from the text ""333-333333-101 BBAN"")
    *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (extracted from the text ""CHAN TAI MAN,MR CHAN TAI MAN"")
    *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (extracted from the text ""111-111111-101 BBAN"")
    *   `from.bank`: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (inferred from the CSV data based on the account number)
    *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (inferred from the CSV data based on the account number)
    *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (extracted from the text ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"")
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 35500.00 (extracted from the text ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD35,500.00"")

5.  **cancel_amount_requested:**
    *   The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD35,500.00"". Therefore, `cancel_amount_requested` is set to 35500.00.

6.  **alerted_transactions Array:**
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the single transaction that was identified and processed.

7.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output adheres strictly to the provided schema, including all required fields.
    *   The output is a valid JSON object with no comments or extraneous text.

        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the ""Financial Crime Type"" field of the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   The fraud alert source mentions ""Tai Man CHAN"" as a suspect. The transaction records contain multiple transactions involving ""CHAN TAI MAN"" on ""2025-01-03"" with amounts 150600, 46000, 100000, 40200 and on ""2025-01-04"" with amount 80000.
    *   For each of these transactions, the date and amount are explicitly present in both the fraud alert source (inferred from the suspect and the transaction records) and the CSV.
    *   The `from.name` ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matches the suspect ""Tai Man CHAN"" in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, all transactions are considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).
    *   For each matched transaction, the data is merged using the following priority: CSV value > Fraud alert source value > null.
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` are populated from the CSV.
        *   `channel` is set to null because the fraud alert source does not specify a channel, and the transaction records do not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".
        *   `cancel_amount_requested` is set to null because the fraud alert source does not request a cancellation for any of the transactions.

3.  **alerted\_transactions Array:** The `alerted_transactions` array contains all matched transactions.

"
UAR,29,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the value in the fraud alert source under the ""Financial Crime Type"" field.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction for HKD 129890.00 on 20241227.
    *   Both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null, so the transaction is considered valid.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with date 2024-12-27 and amount 129890.00 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the CSV match the `from.account_number` and `to.account_number` extracted from the fraud alert source, respectively.
    *   The Originator Name (1/YEUNG KAI) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV match the `from.name` and `to.name` extracted from the fraud alert source, respectively.
    *   Therefore, all matching conditions are met, and `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since `can_be_located` is `true`, the CSV data is prioritized.
    *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""2024-12-27"").
    *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (129890.00).
    *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""HKD"").
    *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""1/YEUNG KAI"").
    *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""666-66666-601"").
    *   `from.bank`: No value in either source, so set to `null`.
    *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"").
    *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""111-111111-101"").
    *   `to.bank`: No value in either source, so set to `null`.
    *   `channel`: Taken from the fraud alert source (""CHATS"").
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: The fraud alert source indicates a request to cancel the payment order and return the funds of HKD 129890.00, so `cancel_amount_requested` is set to 129890.00.

5.  **Schema Compliance:**
    *   All required fields are present in the JSON output.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the matched transaction.
    *   The JSON is valid and contains no comments or extraneous text.
"
UAR,29,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential ""External Fraud"" case.
    *   A transaction is described with the following details:
        *   Date: 20241227 (interpreted as 2024-12-27)
        *   Amount: HKD 158890.00
        *   From Account: 666-66666-601
        *   From Name: 1/YEUNG KAI
        *   To Account: 111-111111-101
        *   To Name: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Channel: CHATS
        *   Cancellation Requested: Yes, for the full amount.

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV file contains two transaction records.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The first transaction in the CSV (amount 129890) was not considered because the amount does not match the amount in the fraud alert source.
    *   The second transaction in the CSV (amount 158890) was matched because:
        *   The date (2024-12-27) and amount (158890) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) matches the `from.account_number` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matches the `to.account_number` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Name (1/YEUNG KAI) matches the `from.name` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the `to.name` in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true` for this transaction.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""2024-12-27"").
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (158890.00).
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""HKD"").

"
UAR,30,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a potential fraudulent FPS payment dated 04JAN25 for HKD300.00.
    *   The source also provides originator and beneficiary details, including names and account numbers.
    *   A cancellation of the payment is requested.
    *   The fraud type is ""External Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The transaction with date 04JAN25 and amount HKD300.00 is considered valid because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction CSV was searched for a matching transaction based on the date (2025-01-04) and amount (300).
    *   The following matching criteria were used:
        *   Date: 2025-01-04 (from CSV) matches 04JAN25 (from fraud alert).
        *   Amount: 300 (from CSV) matches 300.00 (from fraud alert).
        *   Originator Account Number: 666-66666-601 (from CSV) matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert.
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101 (from CSV) matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert.
        *   Originator Name: YEUNG KAI (from CSV) matches the sender name MISS YEUNG KAI (from fraud alert).
        *   Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN, TAIMAN (from CSV) matches the bene name CHAN, TAIMAN (from fraud alert).
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2025-01-04"" (from CSV).
        *   `amount`: 300.00 (from CSV).
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.name`: ""YEUNG KAI"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.account_number`: ""666-66666-601"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.bank`: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV).
        *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source).
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 300.00 (A cancellation is requested in the fraud alert source for the full amount of the transaction).
        *   `can_be_located`: true (because a matching transaction was found in the CSV).

5.  **Output:**
    *   The final JSON output contains the merged data for the identified fraudulent transaction, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the fraudulent transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction for HKD 300.00 on 03JAN25 (January 3, 2025).
    *   Both date and amount are explicitly present, so the transaction is considered valid for investigation.

3.  **Matching with CSV:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2025-01-03"" and Amount ""300"" was found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV match the account numbers implied in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""YEUNG KAI"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" from the CSV match the names mentioned in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the `can_be_located` flag is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2025-01-03"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""300.00"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Name:** The Originator Name ""YEUNG KAI"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Account\_number:** The Originator Account Number ""666-66666-601"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Name:** The Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Account\_number:** The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" is taken from the CSV.
    *   **Channel:** The fraud alert source indicates that the payment was an ""FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel is set to ""FPS"".
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT AND RETURN PROCEEDS"", so the `cancel_amount_requested` is set to the transaction amount of 300.00.
    *   **From.Bank and To.Bank:** These values are not explicitly available in the fraud alert source, so they are set to `null`.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the merged data for the identified fraudulent transaction, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the fraudulent transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with `null` values used where data is unavailable.
"
UAR,30,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Global Field: `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction 1 (HKD 32,300.00 on 2025-01-03):

    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HKD 32,300.00 on 2025-01-03.
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" matched.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `to.name`, `to.account_number` were populated from the CSV record.
        *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` were populated from the CSV record.
        *   `channel` was set to null because the fraud alert source did not specify a channel.
        *   `cancel_amount_requested` was set to null because no cancellation was requested for this transaction.

3.  Transaction 2 (HKD 64,348.00 on 2025-01-03):

    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HKD 64,348.00 on 2025-01-03.
    *   A matching transaction was found in the CSV with the same date and amount.
    *   The Originator Name ""XIE PANGAN"" and Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN, TAIMAN"" matched.
    *   However, the Beneficiary Account Number in the fraud alert source (024-■■■■■■■■■■■) does not match the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (111-111111-101).
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `false`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date` and `amount` were populated from the fraud alert source.
        *   `currency` was set to ""HKD"" from the fraud alert source.
        *   `from.name` and `from.account_number` were populated from the CSV record.
        *   `to.name` was populated from the CSV record.
        *   `to.account_number` was populated from the fraud alert source.
        *   `from.bank` was populated from the CSV record.
        *   `channel` was set to ""FPS"" because the fraud alert source mentions ""FPS REF NO"".
        *   `cancel_amount_requested` was set to null because no cancellation was requested for this transaction.
"
UAR,30,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

    *   Matching: This transaction was found in the CSV. The date (2025-01-03) and amount (64348.00) matched exactly. Also, the Originator Name (XIE PANGAN) and Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN, TAIMAN) matched. Therefore, can\_be\_located was set to true.
    *   Merging:
        *   date: Value from CSV (2025-01-03).
        *   amount: Value from CSV (64348.00).
        *   currency: Value from CSV (HKD).
        *   from.name: Value from CSV (XIE PANGAN).
        *   from.account\_number: Value from CSV (666-66666-603).
        *   from.bank: Value from CSV (INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA (ASIA) LIMITED).
        *   to.name: Value from CSV (""MR      CHAN, TAIMAN"").
        *   to.account\_number: Value from CSV (111-111111-101).

        *   channel: ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
        *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requested cancellation of this payment, so the full amount (64348.00) was used.

3.  Transaction 2 (HKD 32,300.00 on 2025-01-03):
    *   Matching: This transaction was not found in the CSV using the matching rules. Although the date (2025-01-03) and amount (32300.00) are present in the CSV, the Beneficiary Account Number (024-■■■■■■■■) does not match the Originator Account Number or Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV. Also, the Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) does not match the Originator Name or Beneficiary Name in the CSV. Therefore, can\_be\_located was set to false.
    *   Merging:
        *   date: Value from fraud alert source (2025-01-03).
        *   amount: Value from fraud alert source (32300.00).
        *   currency: HKD was extracted from the fraud alert source.
        *   from.name: null.
        *   from.account\_number: null.
        *   from.bank: null.
        *   to.name: Value from fraud alert source (CHAN TAI MAN).

        *   channel: ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source.
        *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requested cancellation of this payment, so the full amount (32300.00) was used.

4.  All other transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source were excluded because they did not contain both date and amount.
"
UAR,30,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction for HKD 2,320.00 on 2025-01-05.
    *   Both the date and amount are explicitly present, so the transaction is considered valid for further processing.
    *   The fraud alert source also mentions a transaction for HKD 250105, but this transaction is excluded because the date is not in the correct format.
    *   The fraud alert source also mentions a transaction for HKD 0.00, but this transaction is excluded because the amount is zero.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction for HKD 2,320.00 on 2025-01-05 was found in the CSV.
    *   The date (2025-01-05) and amount (2320.00) match exactly.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (""MISS TSANG SIU MING"") matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (""111-111111-101"") matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-05"")
        *   `amount`: CSV value (2320.00)
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"")
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""MISS TSANG SIU MING"")
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""666-66666-602"")
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"")
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"")
    *   `channel`: The fraud alert source indicates that the payment was made via ""FPS"", so the channel is set to ""FPS"".
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: The fraud alert source requests a cancellation of the payment for HKD 2,320.00, so `cancel_amount_requested` is set to 2320.00.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is valid JSON.

        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction for HKD 200,000.00 on 2025-02-05. This transaction was extracted for further analysis.

3.  Matching and can\_be\_located Logic:
    *   The transaction with Date ""2025-02-05"" and Amount ""200000"" was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Name and Beneficiary Name in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the can\_be\_located flag was set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was located in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following merging logic was applied:
        *   date: Value from CSV: 2025-02-05
        *   amount: Value from CSV: 200000.00
        *   currency: Value from CSV: HKD
        *   from.name: Value from CSV: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   from.account\_number: Value from CSV: 444-4444444-101
        *   from.bank: Value from CSV: China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
        *   to.name: Value from CSV: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   to.account\_number: Value from CSV: 111-111111-101
        *   to.bank: Value from CSV: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
    *   channel: The fraud alert source indicates that the payment was made via ""FPS"", so the channel was set to ""FPS"".
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL THE PAYMENT AND RETURN FUNDS TO US"", so the cancel\_amount\_requested was set to the transaction amount of 200000.00.
"
UAR,31,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.

Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the ""Financial Crime Type"" field of the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction with the following details:
        *   Date: 2025-02-04
        *   Amount: HKD 110,555.00
    *   The transaction with amount HKD 0.00 was excluded because the amount is zero.
    *   The transaction with amount HKD 250204 was excluded because the date is not explicitly mentioned.

3.  Matching and can\_be\_located Logic:
    *   The transaction with Date 2025-02-04 and Amount 110555.00 was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The following conditions were met:
        *   Date matched exactly.
        *   Amount matched exactly.
        *   Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   Originator Name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) matched.
    *   Therefore, can\_be\_located was set to true for this transaction.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   For the matched transaction (can\_be\_located: true):
        *   Date, amount, currency, from.name, from.account\_number, to.name, and to.account\_number were populated from the CSV.
        *   from.bank and to.bank were populated from the CSV using Originator Bank Raw and Beneficiary Bank Raw respectively.
        *   channel was set to ""FPS"" because the fraud alert source mentions ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"".

5.  cancel\_amount\_requested:
    *   The fraud alert source states ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT REF FRN20250204PAYC■■■■■■■■ FOR HKD110555.00 DD 2025-02-04 CREDITOR NAME : CHAN TAI MAN  ACCT NO. 024N25012■■■■■■■■ DEBTOR NAME : CHEUNG TAK SHING . REMITTER REQUEST RETURN FUNDS DUE TO FRAUD PAYMEHT. PLS CANCEL THE PAYMENT AND RETURN FUNDS TO US."". Therefore, cancel\_amount\_requested was set to 110555.00.

6.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output includes the fraud\_type and an array called alerted\_transactions.
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains one object representing the matched transaction, with all the required fields populated according to the schema and the merging/prioritization logic.

UAR,31,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source under ""Financial Crime Type"".

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction for HKD 50,000.00 on 2025-02-04. This transaction was considered valid because both the date and amount were explicitly present.

3.  Matching Process (can\_be\_located):
    *   The transaction with Date ""2025-02-04"" and Amount ""50000"" was located in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-101"" and Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matched the account numbers implied in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" and Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV matched the names in the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all three conditions were met, can\_be\_located was set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   date: Value from CSV: ""2025-02-04""
        *   amount: Value from CSV: 50000.00
        *   currency: Value from CSV: ""HKD""
        *   from.name: Value from CSV: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING""
        *   from.account\_number: Value from CSV: ""444-4444444-101""
        *   from.bank: Value from CSV: ""China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited""
        *   to.name: Value from CSV: ""CHAN TAI MAN""
        *   to.account\_number: Value from CSV: ""111-111111-101""
        *   to.bank: Value from CSV: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
    *   Channel: The fraud alert source indicates ""FPS"" as the payment method, so channel was set to ""FPS"".
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL THE PAYMENT AND RETURN FUNDS TO US"", so cancel\_amount\_requested was set to 50000.00.

        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HKD 200,000.00 on 05FEB2025 (2025-02-05) involving CHAN TAI MAN. The alert also mentions ""FRAUD FPS RECALL FUNDS"" and ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 05FEB2025 TRANSACTION ID : 25020501064■■■■■■■ FPS REF NO. : FRN20250205PAYC■■■■■■■■■■■■ FOR HKD200,000.00 IN FAVOR OF : CHAN TAI MAN PROXY ID : 122222221 AT YR BANK"". This indicates that the channel is FPS.
    *   The transaction records CSV contains two transactions on 2025-02-05 for HKD 200,000.00 to CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The first transaction has Originator Account Number 444-4444444-101 and Originator Name CHEUNG TAK SHING.
    *   The second transaction has Originator Account Number 666-666666-101 and Originator Name CHEUNG TAK SHING.
    *   Both transactions match the date and amount from the fraud alert source, and the Beneficiary Name is CHAN TAI MAN in both transactions. Therefore, both transactions are considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   For both matched transactions, the date and amount are taken from the CSV to ensure accuracy.
    *   The from.name, from.account\_number, and to.name, to.account\_number are populated from the CSV.
    *   The channel is set to ""FPS"" based on the fraud alert source.
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested is set to 200000.00 because the fraud alert source requests a recall of funds for HKD200,000.00.
    *   can\_be\_located is set to true because the transaction was found in the CSV based on matching date, amount, and at least one of the matching criteria.

4.  Other Transactions:
    *   The transaction for HKD 250205 is excluded because the date is not in a valid YYYY-MM-DD format.
    *   The transaction for HKD 0.00 is excluded because the amount is zero.

5.  Final Output:
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains the two matched and merged transactions.
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the defined schema, including all required fields.
"
UAR,32,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions an FPS payment dated 07AUG24 for HKD4,000.00. This transaction was considered for investigation because it contains both date and amount.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the transaction record in the CSV because:
        *   The date ""2024-08-07"" matches exactly.
        *   The amount ""4000.00"" matches exactly.
        *   The originator account number ""333-333333-102"" and beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" match the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** The date ""2024-08-07"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **amount:** The amount ""4000.00"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.name:** The originator name ""CHUNG SIU"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The originator account number ""333-333333-102"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **from.bank:** The originator bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The beneficiary name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The beneficiary account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **to.bank:** The beneficiary bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source mentions ""FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel was set to ""FPS"".
        *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", and the amount is HKD4,000.00, so the cancel\_amount\_requested was set to 4000.00.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,33,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""03/01/2025"" with an amount of ""HKD18000.00"". Both date and amount are present, so the transaction was considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction record was located in the CSV file because:
        *   The date ""2025-01-03"" matched exactly.
        *   The amount ""18000"" matched exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number ""444-4444444-102"" matched the `from.account_number` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" matched the `to.account_number` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Originator Name ""YAN MEI MEI"" matched the `from.name` in the fraud alert.
        *   The Beneficiary Name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" matched the `to.name` in the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   **date:** The CSV value ""2025-01-03"" was used.
        *   **amount:** The CSV value ""18000.00"" was used.
        *   **currency:** The CSV value ""HKD"" was used.
        *   **from.name:** The CSV value ""YAN MEI MEI"" was used.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The CSV value ""444-4444444-102"" was used.
        *   **from.bank:** The CSV value ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was used.
        *   **to.name:** The CSV value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was used.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The CSV value ""111-111111-101"" was used.
        *   **to.bank:** The CSV value ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED"" was used.
        *   **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel, and the transaction record did not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the value was set to `null`.
        *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source did not specify a cancellation amount, so the value was set to `null`.
5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was constructed according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,37,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction ""DATED 02JAN25 FOR HKD2,000.00"". This transaction contains both date and amount, so it is considered valid for investigation.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Determination:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2025-01-02"" and Amount ""2000.00"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""444-4444444-102"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.name` ""CHUNG SIU"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Since all three conditions are met, the transaction was considered a match, and `can_be_located` was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2025-01-02"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount ""2000.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Name:** The name ""YAN MEI MEI"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Account\_Number:** The account number ""444-4444444-102"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.Bank:** The bank was set to null because the Originator Bank Raw field in the CSV was not populated.
    *   **To.Name:** The name ""CHUNG SIU"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Account\_Number:** The account number ""111-111111-102"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.Bank:** The bank was set to null because the Beneficiary Bank Raw field in the CSV was not populated.
    *   **Channel:** The channel was set to ""FPS"" because the fraud alert source mentions ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"".
    *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so `cancel_amount_requested` was set to 2000.00, which is the full amount of the transaction.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the value in the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source describes a fraudulent transaction on ""02/01/2025"" for ""HKD 2600.00"".
    *   Both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null, so the transaction is considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2025-01-02"" and Amount ""2600"" was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The `from.account_number` ""444-4444444-103"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
    *   The `to.name` ""CHUNG SIU"" from the fraud alert source matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
    *   Since all three conditions are met, the transaction is considered a match, and `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-02"") was used.
        *   `amount`: CSV value (2600.00) was used.
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"") was used.
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""TAN FUNG"") was used.
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""444-4444444-103"") was used.
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""CHUNG SIU"") was used.
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-102"") was used.
        *   `channel`: No channel information was present in the fraud alert source, so it was set to `null`.
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: No cancellation was requested for the transaction, so it was set to `null`.

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
"
UAR,38,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was extracted from the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source and set to ""External Fraud"".

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction explicitly with both date and amount: ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 29DEC24 FOR HKD 116,523.87"". This transaction was considered for further processing.

3.  Matching Process (can\_be\_located):
    *   Date: The date ""29DEC24"" from the fraud alert source was converted to ""2024-12-29"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   Amount: The amount ""116,523.87"" from the fraud alert source was matched exactly.
    *   Matching Criteria: The following information was extracted from the fraud alert source:
        *   Sender Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Sender Account Number: 444-4444444-101
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
    *   The transaction record with the following details matched all criteria:
        *   Transaction Date: 2024-12-29
        *   Originating Amount: 116523.87
        *   Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-101
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
    *   Since all conditions were met, can\_be\_located was set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   date: CSV value (""2024-12-29"")
        *   amount: CSV value (116523.87)
        *   currency: CSV value (""HKD"")
        *   from.name: CSV value (""CHEUNG TAK SHING"")
        *   from.account\_number: CSV value (""444-4444444-101"")
        *   from.bank: CSV value (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"")
        *   to.name: CSV value (""CHAN TAI MAN"")
        *   to.account\_number: CSV value (""111-111111-101"")
        *   to.bank: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."")
    *   Channel: The fraud alert source indicates ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel was set to ""FPS"".
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source states ""PLS URGENTLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so cancel\_amount\_requested was set to the transaction amount (116523.87).

5.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the fraud\_type and the alerted\_transactions array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.
"
UAR,39,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Matching:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""04JAN25"" for ""HKD40,012.00"" involving ""CHAN TAI MAN"" with account number ""111-111111-101"" and ""CHAN TAI MAN"" with account number ""555-555555-101"".
    *   The transaction CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A transaction in the CSV with a date of ""2025-01-04"" and an amount of ""40012"" was found. The Originator Account Number was ""555-555555-101"", the Beneficiary Account Number was ""111-111111-101"", the Originator Name was ""CHAN TAI MAN"", and the Beneficiary Name was ""CHAN TAI MAN"".
    *   Since the date and amount matched exactly, and at least one of the account numbers or names matched, the can\_be\_located flag was set to true.

3.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   date: The date ""2025-01-04"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   amount: The amount ""40012.00"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   currency: The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   from.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV (Originator Name).
    *   from.account\_number: The account number ""555-555555-101"" was taken from the CSV (Originator Account Number).
    *   from.bank: The bank ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" was taken from the CSV (Originator Bank Raw).
    *   to.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV (Beneficiary Name).
    *   to.account\_number: The account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV (Beneficiary Account Number).
    *   to.bank: The bank ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" was taken from the CSV (Beneficiary Bank Raw).
    *   channel: The channel ""FPS"" was extracted from the fraud alert source (""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED..."").
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL PARTIAL AMOUNT HKD40,000.00"", so cancel\_amount\_requested was set to 40000.00.
    *   can\_be\_located: Set to true because a matching transaction was found in the CSV.

UAR,40,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a financial crime type of ""External Fraud"".
    *   The description mentions a transaction: ""HKD 3,000.00CR 024 BBAN 111-111111-101 LOB RBWMSENDER NAME CHEUNG TAK SHING BENE.NAME CHAN TAI MAN...We are advised by remitting bank that quote 20:FPS202501■■■■■■ :21:FPS202501■■■■■■ :79:RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 20250103 FOR HKD3,000.00 FPS REF NO.

PLEASE URGENTLY ARRANGE TO CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT AND RETURN PROCEEDS TO US VIA CHATS QUOTING OUR REF IN FIELD 20 UNDER SWIFT CONFIRMATION TO US.""
    *   This transaction has a date of 20250103 (January 3, 2025) and an amount of HKD 3,000.00.
    *   The sender (from) is CHEUNG TAK SHING, and the beneficiary (to) is CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The source requests cancellation of the payment.
    *   The channel is FPS.

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains one transaction record with the following details:
        *   Date: 2025-01-03
        *   Amount: 3000
        *   Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-101
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Determination:**
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source matches the transaction in the CSV because:
        *   The date (2025-01-03) and amount (3000.00) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) match.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2025-01-03"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 3000.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""ZA Bank Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   `channel`: ""FPS"" (from fraud alert source)
        *   `cancel_amount_requested`: 3000.00 (The fraud alert source requests cancellation of the payment, so the full amount is assumed.)
        *   `can_be_located`: `true`

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output is formatted according to the schema, including all required fields.

If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on 23/12/2024 (converted to 2024-12-23) for HKD 24,150.00.
    *   Both date and amount are explicitly present, so the transaction is considered valid for investigation.

3.  Matching Process (can\_be\_located):
    *   The transaction from the fraud alert source was matched to the first row in the transaction CSV because:
        *   The date (2024-12-23) and amount (24150.00) match exactly.
        *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-102) from the CSV matches the from.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the CSV matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) from the CSV matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, can\_be\_located is set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   date: CSV value (""2024-12-23"")
        *   amount: CSV value (24150.00)
        *   currency: CSV value (""HKD"")
        *   from.name: CSV value (""YAN MEI MEI"")
        *   from.account\_number: CSV value (""444-4444444-102"")
        *   from.bank: CSV value (""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED"")
        *   to.name: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"")
        *   to.account\_number: CSV value (""111-111111-101"")
        *   to.bank: CSV value (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."")
        *   channel: null (no channel specified in the fraud alert source, and no clear indication of ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record)
        *   cancel\_amount\_requested: null (no cancellation requested in the fraud alert source)

5.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The alerted\_transactions array contains one object representing the matched and merged transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, and the JSON is valid according to the schema.
"
UAR,46,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""External Fraud"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a payment dated 18JAN25 for HKD100,000.00 involving MR CHAN TAI MAN with account number 111-111111-101.
    *   This transaction contains both date and amount, so it is considered valid for further processing.

3.  Matching and can\_be\_located Logic:
    *   The transaction with date 2025-01-18 and amount 100000.00 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (333-333333-101) matches the from.account\_number implied from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV (111-111111-101) matches the to.account\_number in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (CHAN TAI MAN) matches the from.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (MR CHAN TAI MAN) matches the to.name in the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all conditions are met, can\_be\_located is set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (can\_be\_located: true), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   date: CSV value (""2025-01-18"")
        *   amount: CSV value (100000.00)
        *   currency: CSV value (""HKD"")
        *   from.name: CSV value (""CHAN TAI MAN"")
        *   from.account\_number: CSV value (""333-333333-101"")
        *   from.bank: Extracted from Originator Bank Raw in CSV (""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"")
        *   to.name: CSV value (""MR CHAN TAI MAN"")
        *   to.account\_number: CSV value (""111-111111-101"")
        *   to.bank: Extracted from Beneficiary Bank Raw in CSV (""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."")
    *   channel: The fraud alert source mentions ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT"", so the channel is set to ""FPS"".
    *   cancel\_amount\_requested: The fraud alert source requests to ""CANCEL ABOVE PAYMENT"", so cancel\_amount\_requested is set to the transaction amount (100000.00).

5.  Final Output:
    *   The final JSON output includes the fraud\_type and an array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.

UAR,48,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` is set to ""External Fraud"" as specified in the fraud alert source under ""Financial Crime Type"".

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date (20250116) and amount (6225.00).
    *   The date was converted to YYYY-MM-DD format (2025-01-16).

3.  **Matching Process (can\_be\_located):**
    *   The transaction with date 2025-01-16 and amount 6225.00 was found in the transaction CSV.
    *   The date and amount matched exactly.
    *   The originator account number (444-4444444-101) and beneficiary account number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   The originator name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and beneficiary name (CHAN TAI MAN) from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: CSV value (""2025-01-16"").
        *   `amount`: CSV value (6225.00).
        *   `currency`: CSV value (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: CSV value (""CHEUNG TAK SHING"").
        *   `from.account_number`: CSV value (""444-4444444-101"").
        *   `to.name`: CSV value (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: CSV value (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `channel`: No channel information was explicitly provided in the fraud alert source, so it is set to null.
    *   `cancel_amount_requested`: No cancellation was requested in the fraud alert source, so it is set to null.
    *   `from.bank` and `to.bank` are set to null because the fraud alert source does not provide this information, and the transaction records do not provide explicit channel information.

5.  **Schema Compliance:**
    *   The output strictly adheres to the provided JSON schema.
    *   All required fields are present.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array is present and contains the processed transaction.

        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a transaction involving a MT192 message with details including:
        *   Date: 16 Jan 2025 (converted to 2025-01-16)
        *   Amount: HKD 44,855.00
        *   Originator Account: 444-4444444-102
        *   Originator Name: YAN MEI MEI
        *   Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
        *   Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Beneficiary Bank BIC: HASEHK
        *   Channel: CHATS
    *   The fraud type is identified as ""External Fraud"".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV file contains two transactions.

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction with a date of 2025-01-16 and an amount of 44855.00 HKD was found in the CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-102) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) from the fraud alert source matched the corresponding fields in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the `can_be_located` flag was set to `true` for this transaction.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **fraud\_type:** The value ""External Fraud"" from the fraud alert source was used.
    *   **Transaction Fields:**
        *   **date:** The value ""2025-01-16"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **amount:** The value 44855.00 from the CSV was used.
        *   **currency:** The value ""HKD"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **from.name:** The value ""YAN MEI MEI"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **from.account\_number:** The value ""444-4444444-102"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **from.bank:** The value was set to null as it was not available in the CSV.
        *   **to.name:** The value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **to.account\_number:** The value ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV was used.
        *   **to.bank:** The value ""HASEHK"" from the fraud alert source was used.
        *   **channel:** The value ""CHATS"" from the fraud alert source was used.
        *   **cancel\_amount\_requested:** The value was set to null as no cancellation was requested in the fraud alert source.
        *   **can\_be\_located:** Set to `true` because a matching record was found in the CSV.

5.  **Output:**
    *   The final JSON output contains the merged data for the identified fraudulent transaction, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the matched transaction.
"
UAR,50,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction)
        For each transaction:
            - If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction.
            - If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction.
            - If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null.

    8. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    9. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Money Laundering"" based on the ""Financial Crime Type"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-01-02, 50627):**
        *   The date (2024-01-02) and amount (50627) were explicitly present in the transaction records.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   Currency was set to ""HKD"" from the CSV.
        *   The to.name and to.account_number were populated from the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-02-16, 16273):**
        *   The date (2024-02-16) and amount (16273) were explicitly present in the transaction records.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   The Originator Name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   Currency was set to ""HKD"" from the CSV.
        *   The to.name, to.account_number, from.name, and from.account_number were populated from the CSV.
        *   The to.bank was populated from the CSV.

    *   **Transaction 3 (2024-04-09, 87540):**
        *   The date (2024-04-09) and amount (87540) were explicitly present in the transaction records.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) and Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matched.
        *   The Originator Name (CHEUNG TAK SHING) and Originator Account Number (444-4444444-101) matched.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` was set to `true`.
        *   Data was merged, prioritizing the CSV values.
        *   Currency was set to ""HKD"" from the CSV.
        *   The to.name, to.account_number, from.name, and from.account_number were populated from the CSV.
        *   The to.bank was populated from the CSV.

3.  **cancel\_amount\_requested:** No cancellation was requested in the fraud alert source for any of the transactions, so `cancel_amount_requested` was set to `null` for all transactions.

4.  **channel:** The fraud alert source did not specify a channel for any of the transactions, so the `channel` field was set to `null` for all transactions.

5.  **Missing Data:** Fields for which no data was available in either the fraud alert source or the transaction records were set to `null`.

ODFT,4,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

      ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
      ""alerted_transactions"": [

Explanation:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type is set to ""Others"" based on the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Extraction and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source contains one transaction with a date (""07 AUG"") and amount (""5,000"").
    *   The date ""07 AUG"" is converted to ""2024-08-07"" to match the format in the transaction records.
    *   The amount ""5,000"" is converted to 5000.00.

3.  Matching and Merging:
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-08-07"" and amount 5000.00 was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number ""111-111111-101"" from the CSV matches the Account No. in the fraud alert source, and the Beneficiary Name ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" matches the Customer Name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name ""YEUNG KAI"" matches the name mentioned in the fraud alert source (""MISS YEUNG KAI"").
    *   Therefore, can\_be\_located is set to true.
    *   Data is merged using the priority: CSV data > Fraud alert source data > null.
        *   date: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV)
        *   amount: 5000.00 (from CSV)
        *   currency: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   from.name: ""YEUNG KAI"" (from CSV)
        *   from.account\_number: ""666-66666-601"" (from CSV)
        *   from.bank: ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (from CSV)
        *   to.name: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   to.account\_number: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   to.bank: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV)
        *   channel: ""Whatsapp"" (from fraud alert source)

4.  Final JSON Output:
    *   The final JSON output contains the fraud\_type and an alerted\_transactions array with one element representing the matched and merged transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is valid JSON.

        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a fraud type of ""Impersonation"".
    *   It describes a transaction where ""MR CHEUNG"" transferred HKD2,430.00 on August 7th via ATM.
    *   The victim's name is ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"".

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV contains multiple transactions on ""2024-08-07"".
    *   It includes a transaction with the following details:
        *   Date: 2024-08-07
        *   Amount: 2430
        *   Originator Name: ""CHEUNG, TAK SHING""
        *   Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
        *   Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
        *   Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
        *   Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction with Date ""2024-08-07"" and Amount ""2430"" was selected for validation.
    *   The date and amount from the fraud alert source matched the CSV record exactly.
    *   The Originator Name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Name ""CHEUNG, TAK SHING"" in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction was considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: The value ""Impersonation"" was taken from the fraud alert source.
    *   `date`: The value ""2024-08-07"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `amount`: The value 2430.00 was taken from the CSV.
    *   `currency`: The value ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.name`: The value ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.account_number`: The value ""222-222222-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `from.bank`: The value was set to null as it was not available in the CSV.
    *   `to.name`: The value ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `to.account_number`: The value ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   `to.bank`: The value was set to null as it was not available in the CSV.
    *   `channel`: The value ""ATM"" was derived from the transaction description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" in the CSV and the fraud alert source stating the transaction was done via ATM.
    *   `can_be_located`: Set to true because a matching record was found in the CSV.

5.  **Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the merged data for the matched transaction, adhering to the specified schema.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains one object representing the fraudulent transaction.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data was unavailable.
"
ODFT,4,14,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert source indicates a case of online shopping fraud.
    *   The victim's name is ""YAN, MEI MEI"" with account number ""222-222222-102"".
    *   A transaction of 3060 HKD on 2024-08-07 is mentioned.

2.  **Transaction CSV Analysis:**
    *   The CSV file contains multiple transactions on 2024-08-07.

3.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions one transaction with both date and amount: 2024-08-07 and 3060.

4.  **Matching and Merging:**
    *   The transaction with date ""2024-08-07"" and amount 3060 was found in the CSV.
    *   The account number ""222-222222-102"" from the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
    *   Therefore, the transaction was considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `fraud_type`: ""Online Shopping Fraud"" (from fraud alert source).
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-07"" (from CSV).
        *   `amount`: 3060 (from CSV).
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.name`: ""YAN, MEI MEI"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-102"" (from CSV).
        *   `from.bank`: null (not available in CSV, so set to null).
        *   `to.name`: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV).
        *   `to.bank`: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (from CSV).
        *   `channel`: null (not specified in the fraud alert source, and no clear indication of ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" in the transaction record).
        *   `can_be_located`: true.

5.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the merged transaction data, with `can_be_located` set to true.
    *   The `fraud_type` is set to ""Online Shopping Fraud"".
    *   All required fields are present, with null values where data was not available.
    *   The output adheres strictly to the provided JSON schema.
"
ODFT,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  Fraud Type: The fraud\_type was set to ""Impersonation"" based on the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  Transaction Identification and Validation:
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a total loss amount of HKD30,000.00. The source also contains the account number and name of the victim, CHEUNG TAK SHING, 222-222222-101.
    *   The fraud alert source specifies that the customer transferred money through an ATM.
    *   The transaction on 2024-07-17 with an amount of 30000 HKD was extracted because both date and amount are explicitly present.

3.  Matching and can\_be\_located Logic:
    *   The transaction with date 2024-07-17 and amount 30000 HKD was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (222-222222-101) matches the Account No. in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (CHEUNG TAK SHING) matches the Customer Name in the fraud alert source.
    *   The Beneficiary Name in the CSV (CHAN TAI MAN) is also present.
    *   Therefore, all matching conditions are met, and can\_be\_located is set to true.

4.  Data Merging and Prioritization:

    *   from.name: The name ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" is present in both the fraud alert source and the CSV. The CSV value was used.
    *   from.account\_number: The account number ""222-222222-101"" is present in both the fraud alert source and the CSV. The CSV value was used.
    *   from.bank: No bank information is available in either source, so it is set to null.
    *   to.name: The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" is present in the CSV.
    *   to.account\_number: The account number ""111-111111-101"" is present in the CSV.
    *   to.bank: No bank information is available in either source, so it is set to null.
    *   channel: The fraud alert source specifies that the customer transferred money through an ATM, so the channel is set to ""ATM"".

"
ODFT,15,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" based on the ""MO"" (Modus Operandi) field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a loss amount of 164024 HKD. The date of the fraud case reported is 2024-08-10.
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A transaction with a date of 2024-08-10 and an amount of 164024 HKD was found.
    *   The account number 222-222222-101 and name CHEUNG TAK SHING from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Account Number and Originator Name in the CSV, respectively.
    *   Therefore, the transaction was considered a match (`can_be_located: true`).

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since a matching transaction was found in the CSV, the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: The value ""2024-08-10"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `amount`: The value 164024.0 was taken from the CSV.
        *   `currency`: The value ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.name`: The value ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.account_number`: The value ""222-222222-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `from.bank`: No value was available in either source, so it was set to `null`.
        *   `to.name`: The value ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.account_number`: The value ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
        *   `to.bank`: No value was available in either source, so it was set to `null`.
        *   `channel`: The fraud alert source specifies ""Others"" as the channel, but does not provide a specific channel value. The transaction record does not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" so the channel was set to `null`.
        *   `can_be_located`: Set to `true` because a matching transaction was found.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" based on the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a loss amount of 10169 HKD.
    *   The fraud alert source mentions the victim's account number as 222-222222-102 and name as YAN MEI MEI.
    *   The fraud alert source mentions the fraud case reported date as 2024-08-10.
    *   The transaction with date 2024-08-10 and amount 10169 was extracted as a valid transaction.

3.  **Matching and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   A transaction with a date of 2024-08-10 and an amount of 10169 HKD was found in the CSV.
    *   The account number 222-222222-102 and name YAN MEI MEI from the fraud alert source matched the Originator Account Number and Originator Name in the CSV, respectively.
    *   Therefore, the `can_be_located` field was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   **Date:** The date ""2024-08-10"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Amount:** The amount 10169 was taken from the CSV.
    *   **Currency:** The currency ""HKD"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.name:** The name ""YAN MEI MEI"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.account\_number:** The account number ""222-222222-102"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **From.bank:** The bank was set to `null` as it was not present in either source.
    *   **To.name:** The name ""CHAN TAI MAN"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.account\_number:** The account number ""111-111111-101"" was taken from the CSV.
    *   **To.bank:** The bank was set to `null` as it was not present in either source.
    *   **Channel:** The channel was set to `null` as it was not explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source.
"
ODFT,15,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a case of impersonation (""MO: Impersonation"").
    *   The reported date is 2024-08-19, but this is not relevant to the transaction matching.
    *   The suspect account number is 111-111111-101, and the customer name is CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The fraud payment details mention a transfer of 98001 on 8月11日 (August 11).

2.  **Transaction Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source provides one transaction with both date (August 11) and amount (98001).

3.  **Matching Process:**
    *   The transaction of 98001 on 2024-08-11 was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The date and amount matched exactly.
    *   The beneficiary account number in the CSV (111-111111-101) matched the account number in the fraud alert source.
    *   Therefore, the `can_be_located` flag was set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2024-08-11"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 98001 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""YEUNG KAI"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""66666666601"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (not available in either source)
        *   `channel`: ""ATM"" (The transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
        *   `can_be_located`: true

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data was not available.

ODFT,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Impersonation"" based on the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions two transactions on ""10DEC"" and ""11DEC"" with amounts of ""HKD46,000.00"" each. Both transactions contain date and amount, so they are considered valid.

3.  **Transaction Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-10, HKD46,000.00):**
        *   The date ""2024-12-10"" and amount ""46000"" match a row in the CSV.
        *   The `from.account_number` ""222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert matches the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:
            *   `date`, `amount`, and `currency` are taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.account_number` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER"".
    *   **Transaction 2 (2024-12-11, HKD46,000.00):**
        *   The date ""2024-12-11"" and amount ""46000"" match a row in the CSV.
        *   The `from.account_number` ""222-222222-101"" from the fraud alert matches the ""Originator Account Number"" in the CSV.
        *   The `from.name` ""MR CHEUNG TAK SHING"" from the fraud alert matches the ""Originator Name"" in the CSV.
        *   The `to.name` ""MR CHEUNG TAK SHING"" from the fraud alert matches the ""Beneficiary Name"" in the CSV.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:
            *   `date`, `amount`, and `currency` are taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.account_number` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `from.name` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `to.name` is taken from the CSV.
            *   `channel` is set to ""ATM"" because the transaction record indicates ""ATM TRANSFER"".

4.  **Final JSON Output:** The `alerted_transactions` array contains the two merged transaction objects. The output strictly adheres to the JSON schema.

Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Online Shopping Fraud"" directly from the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction 1:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""11月29日"" (November 29) with an amount of ""100k"" (100000 HKD) being transferred to a Hang Seng account ""111-111111-101"" from a Standard Chartered account.
    *   The transaction record contains a transaction on 2024-11-29 with an amount of 100000 HKD, from account number 666-66666-601 at STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED with name YEUNG KAI to account number 111-111111-101 at Hang Seng Bank Ltd. with name MR CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The date and amount match exactly. The to.account\_number matches. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were taken from the transaction record.
        *   `channel` was set to ""FPS"" from the fraud alert source.

3.  **Transaction 2:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction on ""11月29日"" (November 29) with an amount of ""100k"" (100000 HKD) being transferred to a Hang Seng account ""111-111111-101"" from an account with name CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The transaction record contains a transaction on 2024-11-29 with an amount of 100000 HKD, from account number 333-333333-101 at The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited with name CHAN TAI MAN to account number 111-111111-101 at Hang Seng Bank Ltd. with name MR CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The date and amount match exactly. The to.account\_number matches. Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
    *   Data was merged as follows:
        *   `date`, `amount`, `currency`, `from.name`, `from.account_number`, `from.bank`, `to.name`, `to.account_number`, and `to.bank` were taken from the transaction record.
        *   `channel` was set to ""FPS"" from the fraud alert source.
"
ODFT,29,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

Explanation of matching and merging decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Investment Fraud"" directly from the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions two transactions: one for HKD158890 on 2024/12/27 and another for HKD129890 on 2024/12/27. Both transactions include both date and amount, so they are considered valid.

3.  **Matching and Merging:**

    *   **Transaction 1 (2024-12-27, HKD158890):**
        *   The date (2024-12-27) and amount (158890) match a row in the CSV.
        *   The Originator Account Number (666-66666-601) from the CSV matches the account number mentioned in the fraud alert source.
        *   The Beneficiary Name (MR CHAN TAI MAN) from the CSV matches the name mentioned in the fraud alert source.
        *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.
        *   Data is merged:

"
ODFT,36,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Online Shopping Fraud"" directly from the ""MO"" field in the fraud alert source.

2.  **Transaction Extraction and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a total loss amount of HKD18000. The date is implicitly mentioned as 2025-01-02 in the fraud case reported date.
    *   The transaction with amount 18000 and date 2025-01-02 is considered a valid transaction for investigation.

3.  **Matching Attempts and `can_be_located` Logic:**
    *   The transaction with amount 18000 and date 2025-01-02 was not found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   Therefore, `can_be_located` is set to `false`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since `can_be_located` is `false`, only data from the fraud alert source is used for the transaction.
    *   `date`: ""2025-01-02"" (from fraud case reported date in the fraud alert source)
    *   `amount`: 18000.0 (from ""Total Loss Amount in HASE"" in the fraud alert source)
    *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (extracted from ""Total Loss Amount in HASE"" in the fraud alert source)
    *   `from.name`: ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"" (from ""Customer Name"" in the fraud alert source)
    *   `from.account_number`: ""222-222222-101"" (from ""Victim Account No."" in the fraud alert source)
    *   `from.bank`: null (not available in the fraud alert source)
    *   `to.name`: null (not available in the fraud alert source)
    *   `to.account_number`: null (not available in the fraud alert source)
    *   `to.bank`: null (not available in the fraud alert source)
    *   `channel`: ""Others"" (from ""Channel"" in the fraud alert source)

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output includes the `fraud_type` and an `alerted_transactions` array containing the single transaction with the merged data.
    *   All required fields are present, with null values used where data is unavailable.
    *   The output is valid JSON and adheres to the specified schema.

""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

### Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:

1.  **Fraud Type:** The `fraud_type` was set to ""Smishing Attack"" directly from the fraud alert source (MO field).

2.  **Transaction Identification and Validation:**
    *   The fraud alert source mentions a transaction of HKD10000.0 on 02/1/2025 involving Cheung Tak Shing's account 222-222222-101.
    *   The date was converted to YYYY-MM-DD format (2025-01-02).
    *   Both date and amount are present, so the transaction is considered valid for further processing.

3.  **Matching Process (can_be_located):**
    *   The transaction record CSV was searched for a matching transaction.
    *   A transaction was found on 2025-01-02 with an amount of HKD10000.0.
    *   The Originator Account Number in the CSV (222-222222-101) matches the account number from the fraud alert source.
    *   The Originator Name in the CSV (CHEUNG TAK SHING) matches the name from the fraud alert source.
    *   Since all matching criteria are met, `can_be_located` is set to `true`.

4.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   Since the transaction was found in the CSV (`can_be_located: true`), the following prioritization was applied:
        *   `date`: Taken from the CSV (""2025-01-02"").
        *   `amount`: Taken from the CSV (10000.0).
        *   `currency`: Taken from the CSV (""HKD"").
        *   `from.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHEUNG TAK SHING"").
        *   `from.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""222-222222-101"").
        *   `from.bank`: No value in either source, so set to `null`.
        *   `to.name`: Taken from the CSV (""CHAN TAI MAN"").
        *   `to.account_number`: Taken from the CSV (""111-111111-101"").
        *   `to.bank`: No value in either source, so set to `null`.
        *   `channel`: Taken from the fraud alert source (""Whatsapp"").

5.  **Final JSON Output:**
    *   The final JSON output was assembled according to the schema, including the `fraud_type` and the `alerted_transactions` array containing the merged transaction data.
    *   All required fields are present, and the output is a valid JSON object.
"
ODFT,48,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with two documents: an unstructured fraud alert source and a structured CSV file of transaction records.

Your task is to identify the fraudulent transactions described in the fraud alert source, match them to their corresponding entries in the transaction CSV, and produce a single consolidated JSON output that merges and reflects all relevant information. After generating the JSON, you must also provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions.

Key Instructions:

    1. Core Task:
        - Extract only transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source that contain both date and amount.
        - Use the transaction CSV as the authoritative source to verify, correct, and enrich transaction data.

    2. Step-by-Step Process:
        a. Carefully read the fraud alert source to extract global fields and identify transactions to investigate.
        b. Validate transactions:
            - For each transaction, check if both date and amount are explicitly present and non-null.
            - Immediately exclude transactions missing either field.
        c. For each valid transaction:
            - Search the CSV for a matching row using the rules below.
            - If matched: Merge data using prioritization logic (set can_be_located: true).
            - If unmatched: Use only fraud alert data (set can_be_located: false).
        d. If no valid transactions remain, set alerted_transactions to an empty list [].
        e. Assemble the final JSON output according to the schema.

    3. Matching Rules (can_be_located logic):
        A transaction from the fraud alert source matches a CSV row only if all three of the following conditions are met:
            1. The date must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            2. The amount must be explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source and matches exactly with the CSV.
            3. At least one of the following is true:
                - The from.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Account Number in the CSV.
                - The to.account_number in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Account Number in the CSV.
                - The from.name in the fraud alert source matches the Originator Name in the CSV.
                - The to.name in the fraud alert source matches the Beneficiary Name in the CSV.

    4. Data Merging and Prioritization:
        - For the global field fraud_type: Always use the value from the fraud alert source.
        - For transaction fields:
            - If a transaction is not found in the CSV (can_be_located: false): Use only data from the fraud alert source.
            - If a transaction is found in the CSV (can_be_located: true): For each field, use the following priority:
                1. CSV value (if present and not blank)
                2. Fraud alert source value (if CSV value is blank or missing)
                3. null (if neither source provides a value)

    5. Data Handling:
        - Preserve content: Do not remove or alter non-printable characters or artifacts; preserve content exactly as found.
        - Whitespace: You may trim leading/trailing whitespace, but do not alter internal whitespace.

    6. Strict Schema and Format Compliance:
        - The final output must strictly follow the JSON schema below.
        - All specified fields must be present. If a value cannot be found, use null (do not omit the key).
        - Never output transactions with null/missing date or amount.
        - The alerted_transactions array must always be present in the output, and if no valid transactions are found, it must be an empty list.
        - Output must be a valid JSON object only, with no comments or extraneous text.

    7. Explanation Requirement:
        - After producing the JSON output, provide a clear explanation of your matching and merging decisions. This should include which transactions were matched or unmatched, how can_be_located was determined, and how data from the sources was prioritized for each field.

    8. Additional Rules:
        - Transaction Role in the transaction records can be either ""Suspect Transaction"" or ""Victim Transaction"". ""Suspect Transaction"" and ""Victim Transaction"" can refer to the same transaction, from the suspect's and the victim's perspectives respectively. Therefore, if both roles are present for the same transaction (i.e., matching date and amount and at least one of the matching criteria specified in the matching rules), information from both perspectives should be combined when merging data for that transaction.
        - For the per-transaction channel field (payment method used): Only extract channel values that are present in the fraud alert source (for example, ""FPS"" if stated in the source). If the fraud alert source does not specify a channel and the transaction record clearly indicates (even if not fully explicit) that the channel is ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit,"" you may use ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"" as the channel value (do not include any additional descriptive text; output only ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit""). Otherwise, do not use or infer channel values from the transaction records.

**Explanation of Matching and Merging Decisions:**

1.  **Fraud Alert Source Analysis:**
    *   The fraud alert indicates a case of impersonation.
    *   The victim's account number is 111-111111-101, and the suspect's account number is 444-4444444-102.
    *   The total loss amount is HKD 44,855.00.
    *   The suspect's name is YAN MEI MEI, and the victim's name is CHAN TAI MAN.
    *   The fraud payment channel is ""Others"".

2.  **Transaction Validation and Matching:**
    *   The transaction with a date of 2025-01-16 and an amount of 44855.00 was found in the transaction records CSV.
    *   The date and amount match exactly.
    *   The Originator Account Number (444-4444444-102) matches the suspect's account number from the fraud alert.
    *   The Beneficiary Account Number (111-111111-101) matches the victim's account number from the fraud alert.
    *   The Originator Name (YAN MEI MEI) matches the suspect's name from the fraud alert.
    *   The Beneficiary Name (CHAN TAI MAN) matches the victim's name from the fraud alert.
    *   Therefore, the transaction was considered a match (can\_be\_located: true).

3.  **Data Merging and Prioritization:**
    *   `fraud_type`: Set to ""Impersonation"" from the fraud alert source.
    *   For the matched transaction:
        *   `date`: ""2025-01-16"" (from CSV)
        *   `amount`: 44855.00 (from CSV)
        *   `currency`: ""HKD"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.name`: ""YAN MEI MEI"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.account_number`: ""444-4444444-102"" (from CSV)
        *   `from.bank`: ""中国工商银行"" (from fraud alert source)
        *   `to.name`: ""CHAN TAI MAN"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.account_number`: ""111-111111-101"" (from CSV)
        *   `to.bank`: null (no bank information available in CSV or fraud alert)
        *   `channel`: null (the fraud alert source specifies ""Others"" as the channel, but does not provide a specific payment method. The transaction record does not clearly indicate ""ATM"" or ""Cash Deposit"".)
        *   `can_be_located`: true

4.  **JSON Output:**
    *   The JSON output strictly adheres to the schema, including all required fields.
    *   The `alerted_transactions` array contains the matched and merged transaction.
