ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV records, applying the necessary rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
ADCC,16,16,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
ADCC,23,23,12,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV records, applying the necessary rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
ADCC,28,28,1,"[1, 2, 3, 4]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
ADCC,31,31,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"Let's go through the process step-by-step to extract the transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to the CSV records, merge the data, and apply the transaction rules to build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we identify the following transactions:

1. **Date:** 2025-02-04, **Amount:** 110555, **Currency:** HKD, **Remitting Bank:** CCBA, **Depositor AC No.:** 444-4444444-101, **Depositor AC Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING, **Beneficiary Account No.:** 111-111111-101, **Beneficiary Account Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
2. **Date:** 2025-02-04, **Amount:** 50000, **Currency:** HKD, **Remitting Bank:** CCBA, **Depositor AC No.:** 444-4444444-101, **Depositor AC Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING, **Beneficiary Account No.:** 111-111111-101, **Beneficiary Account Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
3. **Date:** 2025-02-05, **Amount:** 200000, **Currency:** HKD, **Remitting Bank:** CCBA, **Depositor AC No.:** 444-4444444-101, **Depositor AC Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING, **Beneficiary Account No.:** 111-111111-101, **Beneficiary Account Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, merges the data, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
ADCC,35,35,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2025-01-27** and it is under the investigation by **DIT 3 ■■■■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and TSTDIV ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 3 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Amount:** 130000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING (Account Number: 444-4444444-101)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (Account Number: 122222221)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Let's match the reported transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Amount:** 130000
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING (Account Number: 444-4444444-101)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (Account Number: 122222221)

In the CSV, we find the following transaction:

- **Transaction Date (value):** 2025-01-20
- **Originating Amount:** 130000
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 6f7549ca-21d3-4f5b-bbfa-bebd7e49290f

The reported transaction matches the CSV transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, and names. However, the beneficiary account number in the source (122222221) does not match the one in the CSV (111-111111-101). Since the names and amounts match, we will use the single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction ID:** 6f7549ca-21d3-4f5b-bbfa-bebd7e49290f
- **Date:** 2025-01-20
- **Amount:** 130000
- **Currency:** HKD

  - **account_number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **bank:** Bank of Communications (Hong Kong) Ltd.

  - **account_number:** 111-111111-101
  - **bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **can_be_located:** true
- **transaction_references:** [""6f7549ca-21d3-4f5b-bbfa-bebd7e49290f""]

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and KT RN ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
ADCC,38,38,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
ADCC,38,38,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■/2025 and e-Hub ■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Should you have any enquiry, please feel free to contact the undersigned or our officers at 286■■■■■. Thank you!

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce a structured and enriched output."
ADCC,41,41,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and MKDIST ■■■■■■■ (DIT 1 ■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

This JSON output consolidates the transaction details from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, applying the necessary rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
ADCC,45,45,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, merges the necessary data, and applies the transaction rules as specified."
ADCC,49,49,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■/2025 and WTSDIST ■■■■■■■■ (DIT 2 ■■■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-16
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Remitting Bank:** HSBC
- **Depositor AC No.:** 444-4444444-101
- **Depositor AC Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Account No.:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Account Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Let's match the reported transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date:** 2025-01-16
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

#### Exact Match:
- **Transaction ID:** 9efec3dc-bb03-4c9b-a71c-4121d437b0d2
  - **Date:** 2025-01-16
  - **Amount:** 100000

  - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Since an exact match is found, we will use this single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** 9efec3dc-bb03-4c9b-a71c-4121d437b0d2

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-10-06
- **Amount:** HKD 40,000.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** Nil
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2024-10-06
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV file, we find the following transaction:

- **Transaction Date:** 10/6/2024
- **Originating Amount:** 40000
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Transaction ID:** aa50d8f8-ab15-4336-a6dc-bc75043ec68e

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** 2024-10-06
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Based on the Transaction Code Description ""UNRELATED ELECTRONIC TRANSFER CREDIT"" and Transaction Type Source ""CUTF"", the channel is ""FPS"".
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""aa50d8f8-ab15-4336-a6dc-bc75043ec68e""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (as determined from the CSV)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

HSBC Referral,3,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,4,4,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:

  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** NIL
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account number/name.

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
- **Date:** 2024-11-12

  - Date: 2024-11-12
  - Amount: 50000
  - Currency: HKD
  - From: { name: ""CHAN TAI MAN"", account_number: ""333-333333-101"", bank: ""HSBC"" }
  - To: { name: ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"", account_number: ""111-111111-101"", bank: ""HASE"" }
  - Channel: ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)
  - Can Be Located: true
  - Transaction References: [""191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab""]

#### Transaction 2: Date: 2024-11-12, Amount: HKD 56,000.00

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,5,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, merges the data, and applies the transaction rules as specified."
HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** HKD 16,500.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 16500
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Looking at the CSV, we find an exact match:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Originating Amount:** 16500
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID:** 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 16500
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, ensuring all required fields are included and the transaction rules are applied correctly."
HSBC Referral,7,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

None of the transactions in the CSV match the exact amount of HKD 20,000. However, we can look for a combination of transactions that sum up to HKD 20,000 and have the same date and beneficiary account number.

#### Possible Combinations:
- **Combination 1:**
  - **Transaction ID:** 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741 (HKD 10,000)
  - **Transaction ID:** ed5b6314-0a34-4938-9d4d-538699aa09bc (HKD 10,000)

However, the sum of these two transactions is HKD 40,000, which does not match the reported amount of HKD 20,000.

Since no exact match or combination of transactions that sum up to HKD 20,000 is found, we set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no match was found, we use the data from the fraud alert source and set the missing fields to null.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""

HSBC Referral,15,15,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK LTD. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2024-12-23
- **Amount:** 20000
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV record:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-12-23
- **Originating Amount:** 20000
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Transaction ID:** 6d4ca699-49ff-4b0c-aa14-34f3ccadadca

This CSV record matches the reported transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the source:

- **Transaction ID:** 6d4ca699-49ff-4b0c-aa14-34f3ccadadca
- **Date:** 2024-12-23
- **Amount:** 20000

- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""6d4ca699-49ff-4b0c-aa14-34f3ccadadca""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""Branch"" (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

HSBC Referral,22,22,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and consistent."
HSBC Referral,22,22,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and consistent."
HSBC Referral,23,23,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 3 Dec 2024
- **Amount:** HKD 50,001.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK LTD.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** 50001 + 7001 + 5001 = 50001 + 12002 = 50001 + 7001 + 5001 = 50,001.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Let's check the CSV for matching transactions:

1. **Transaction ID: 8d0c5549-e4ef-41ed-ad29-cc12542d2cbc**
   - **Date:** 2024-12-03
   - **Amount:** 2997
   - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2. **Transaction ID: 9ba7b992-e84f-4111-86d7-50237f6498b9**
   - **Date:** 2024-12-03
   - **Amount:** 50001
   - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

3. **Transaction ID: 9a5a0cbb-10fa-4cbc-863d-8fe67338282c**
   - **Date:** 2024-12-03
   - **Amount:** 7001
   - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

4. **Transaction ID: 76006eaf-d3ee-4bbd-ac66-ed5004287bc3**
   - **Date:** 2024-12-03
   - **Amount:** 5001
   - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Summing the amounts of transactions 9ba7b992-e84f-4111-86d7-50237f6498b9, 9a5a0cbb-10fa-4cbc-863d-8fe67338282c, and 76006eaf-d3ee-4bbd-ac66-ed5004287bc3:
- 50001 + 7001 + 5001 = 50,001.00

These three transactions match the reported transaction in terms of date, originator account number, beneficiary account number, and total amount.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will use the CSV values for the transaction fields and fill in missing fields with the fraud alert source values.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **channel:** Based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, merges the data, and applies the transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,23,23,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 3 Dec 2024
- **Amount:** HKD 2,997.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK LTD.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the following criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** 2997
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Let's check the CSV for an exact match:

- **Transaction ID:** 8d0c5549-e4ef-41ed-ad29-cc12542d2cbc
  - **Date:** 2024-12-03
  - **Amount:** 2997
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

This transaction matches all the criteria exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for the transaction fields and applying the bank and channel rules:

- **Transaction ID:** 8d0c5549-e4ef-41ed-ad29-cc12542d2cbc
- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** 2997
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch (since the Transaction Type Source is CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

The transaction rules have been applied as follows:
- **from.bank:** HSBC
- **to.bank:** HASE
- **channel:** Branch

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Impersonation"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-12-03"",

HSBC Referral,23,23,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, merges the data, and applies the specified transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,24,24,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Looking at the CSV file, we find the following transaction:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Originating Amount:** 25900
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number. Therefore, we can use this single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21
- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 25900
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document

- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-602
- **Originator Name:** TSANG SIU MING
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** NIL
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2024-11-24
- **Amount:** 49833
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-602
- **Originator Name:** TSANG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** NIL
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Looking at the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID: f5fa17c3-ef5e-4e52-8be9-35615946b6f6**
   - **Date:** 2024-11-24
   - **Amount:** 49833

   - **Originator Name:** TSANG SIU MING
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number. The originator name also matches, but the beneficiary name is different (NIL vs. MR CHAN TAI MAN). However, since the account numbers match, we can consider this a valid match.

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,27,27,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 150,600.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 150,600.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Let's check the CSV for an exact match:

1. **Exact Match:**
   - **Transaction Date:** 2025-01-03
   - **Originating Amount:** 150600
   - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Transaction ID:** 9788c5ac-2d27-41f2-9886-30d4a5d9e953

Since we found an exact match, we will use this single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for the transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** 9788c5ac-2d27-41f2-9886-30d4a5d9e953
- **Date:** 2025-01-03

- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""9788c5ac-2d27-41f2-9886-30d4a5d9e953""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and consistent."
HSBC Referral,27,27,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, merges the data, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,30,30,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, ensuring all required fields are included and the transaction rules are applied correctly."
HSBC Referral,32,32,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
HSBC Referral,34,34,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
HSBC Referral,34,34,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
HSBC Referral,37,37,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 04 Jan 2025
- **Amount:** HKD 40,012.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 555-555555-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HANG SENG BANK LTD.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the date ""04 Jan 2025"" and the amount ""40,012.00"".

#### Exact Match Search
- **Date:** 2025-01-04
- **Amount:** 40012
- **Originator Account Number:** 555-555555-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 742e9b4e-b4b8-44e5-83f4-694eb7b06a64

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** 2025-01-04
- **Amount:** 40012
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 555-555555-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""742e9b4e-b4b8-44e5-83f4-694eb7b06a64""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, ensuring all required fields are included and the transaction rules are applied correctly."
HSBC Referral,43,43,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-18
- **Amount:** HKD 100,000.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account number/name.

- **Date:** 2025-01-18
- **Amount:** 100,000
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Looking at the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 8eff8042-5193-4c39-9735-cccede76f0fd
  - **Date:** 2025-01-18
  - **Amount:** 100,000
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for the transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** 8eff8042-5193-4c39-9735-cccede76f0fd
- **Date:** 2025-01-18
- **Amount:** 100,000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC

- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""8eff8042-5193-4c39-9735-cccede76f0fd""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, ensuring all required fields are included and the transaction rules are applied."
HSBC Referral,47,47,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned:

- **Date:** 16 Jan 2025
- **Amount:** HKD 100,000.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
- **Originator Name:** YAN MEI MEI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following criteria:
- **Date:** 16 Jan 2025
- **Amount:** HKD 100,000.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV records:

1. **Transaction ID: 9efec3dc-bb03-4c9b-a71c-4121d437b0d2**
   - **Date:** 2025-01-16
   - **Amount:** HKD 100,000
   - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

2. **Transaction ID: b44aafc5-297c-4c25-8827-6f31af5a655e**
   - **Date:** 2025-01-16
   - **Amount:** HKD 100,000
   - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** YAN MEI MEI
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

The second transaction (Transaction ID: b44aafc5-297c-4c25-8827-6f31af5a655e) matches all the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction ID:** b44aafc5-297c-4c25-8827-6f31af5a655e
- **Date:** 2025-01-16
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YAN MEI MEI
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: CWTF)
- **can_be_located:** true
- **transaction_references:** [""b44aafc5-297c-4c25-8827-6f31af5a655e""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** HSBC
- **to.bank:** HASE
- **channel:** FPS

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
Police Letter,4,4,11,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transaction details from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, ensuring all required fields are included and the data is enriched according to the specified rules."
Police Letter,4,4,12,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
Police Letter,9,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
Police Letter,11,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Heng Sang Bank 222-222222-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** Heng Sang Bank 222-222222-101

#### CSV Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

The reported transaction matches the CSV transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, and originator account number. Therefore, we use the single Transaction ID from the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500

Police Letter,12,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**

    }
  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-07-28
- **Amount:** 17000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** CASH CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2024-07-28, 17000, CASH CASH

- **Exact Match:**
  - **CSV Record:**
    - **Date:** 2024-07-28
    - **Amount:** 17000
    - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
    - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
    - **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)
    - **Transaction ID:** 26b04c08-dcd9-41e8-a77d-ec8174c7d234

Since there is an exact match, we will use the single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-07-28, 17000, CASH CASH

- **Transaction References:** [""26b04c08-dcd9-41e8-a77d-ec8174c7d234""]
- **CSV Data:**
  - **Date:** 2024-07-28
  - **Amount:** 17000
  - **Currency:** HKD
  - **From:**
    - **Name:** null
    - **Account Number:** null
    - **Bank:** null
  - **To:**
    - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
    - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
    - **Bank:** HASE
  - **Channel:** ""cash deposits via ATM"" (since the source file mentions CASH CASH and the CSV description is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"")

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** null (no bank name mentioned in the source file)
  - **to.bank:** HASE (always HASE for the beneficiary)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** ""cash deposits via ATM"" (since the source file mentions CASH CASH and the CSV description is ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"")

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, applying the necessary rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
Police Letter,14,14,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
Police Letter,17,17,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
Police Letter,17,17,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,18,18,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

VTM denied making the registration
and requested for cancellation. WP offered to cancel the registration and
requested VTM to transfer HK$5,000 as guarantee money. WP claimed that
the money would be refunded to VTM later. Believing so, VTM transferred
HK$5,000 (S/Ppty) via ATM transfer to WP's bank account as instructed. WP
eventually became out of reach and VTM did not receive the promised
refund. Case was reported. VTM could not provide WP's account number at

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case YUEN ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
Police Letter,28,28,2,"[1, 2, 3, 4]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Police Letter,30,30,10,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields."
Police Letter,32,32,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-08-15
- **Amount:** 5000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** HSB 333-333333-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-08-15
- **Amount:** 5000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** HSB 333-333333-101

#### CSV Transactions:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Originating Amount:** 4000
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-102
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 75bcc7da-a0f5-489c-bd93-c73374973b13

**Matching Result:**
- No exact match found for the reported transaction (2024-08-15, 5000, HSB 333-333333-101).
- No combination of CSV transactions that match the reported transaction date and amount.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no match was found, we will set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSB (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
  - `to.bank`: HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Since no CSV transaction matched, the channel will be `null`.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Employment Fraud"",
  ""police_reference"": ""POLICEREF1"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 9"",

Police Letter,33,33,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 49553
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** HSBC 444-4444444-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2025-01-03, 49553, HSBC 444-4444444-101

- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 49553
  - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Transaction ID:** 034ff55d-7ab5-4bb3-b785-0590ce9192aa

Since we found an exact match, we will use this single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 034ff55d-7ab5-4bb3-b785-0590ce9192aa

- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 49553

  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ATM (based on ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" in CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""034ff55d-7ab5-4bb3-b785-0590ce9192aa""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** HSBC (as mentioned in the CSV)
  - **to.bank:** HASE (as per the rule)

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, applying the necessary rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
Police Letter,33,33,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

message from WP1 via """"WhatsApp"""" who claimed to be an investment expert.

in the US stock market via a bogus platform (deactivated). WP1 told VTM
that she could earn over HK$2,000,000 in the US stock market investment
within two months and claimed that he would manage the stock investment
for VTM. Feeling interested, VTM contacted the customer service of the
bogus platform (WP2), who provided 22 FPS accounts and two e-wallet
accounts to VTM. Later, VTM followed WP2's instructions and opened an
account on the bogus platform. Between 2024-12-30 and 2025-02-14, VTM
transferred a total of HK$ 1,856,610 (S/ppty1-24) to 22 FPS accounts and
two e-wallet accounts provided by WP2. Later, VTM failed to retrieve her
money and WP1-2 became out of reach. VTM has always surfed social media
(WhatsApp) and is unaware of the anti-deception campaign launched by the
Force.</td></tr>

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
Police Letter,38,38,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** ZA Bank 444-4444444-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** ZA Bank 444-4444444-101

#### CSV Transaction:
- **Transaction Date (value):** 2025-01-03
- **Originating Amount:** 3000
- **Originator Bank Raw:** ZA Bank Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 991983d6-a911-441b-a724-3619aec754d1

The reported transaction matches the CSV transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, and originator account number. Therefore, we can use the single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction ID:** 991983d6-a911-441b-a724-3619aec754d1
- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **account_number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **bank:** ZA Bank Limited
- **To:**
  - **name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **account_number:** 111-111111-101
  - **bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** ZA Bank Limited (as mentioned in the CSV)
- **to.bank:** HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (as per the rule for ""CWTF"")

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the transaction data enriched and adjusted according to the specified rules."
Police Letter,42,42,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
Police Letter,42,42,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transactions are explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

1. **Date:** 2024-12-09
   **Amount:** 89967
   **Transferor's Bank and Account:** HSB 222-222222-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2024-12-09, 89967, HSB 222-222222-101

- **Exact Match:** No exact match found with the same date, amount, and account.
- **Combination Match:**
  - **2024-12-09, 49967, HSB 222-222222-101** (Transaction ID: b156f110-dc5e-4bfb-baab-138657fbe70e)
  - **2024-12-09, 10000, CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)** (Transaction ID: 1c70bce5-a46e-4791-9d2b-3414ff04fe26)
  - **2024-12-09, 10000, CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)** (Transaction ID: 7b54a738-9500-4076-bc9f-e766d451a5b0)

  Sum of these transactions: 49967 + 10000 + 10000 + 20000 = 89967

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-12-09, 89967, HSB 222-222222-101

- **Transaction References:** [""b156f110-dc5e-4bfb-baab-138657fbe70e"", ""1c70bce5-a46e-4791-9d2b-3414ff04fe26"", ""7b54a738-9500-4076-bc9f-e766d451a5b0"", ""74a2ff0a-8532-4f51-a9e4-8c13d12d5d75""]

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
Police Letter,44,44,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transactions are explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

1. **Date:** 2025-01-01 to 2025-01-26
   **Amount:** $306,820-HKD
   **Note:** This is a total amount transferred over 15 occasions.

Since the source does not provide individual transactions, we will assume that the total amount of $306,820-HKD is the sum of multiple transactions. We will need to match this total to the CSV records.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find transactions in the CSV that sum up to $306,820-HKD between 2025-01-01 and 2025-01-26.

#### Transactions in CSV:
1. **Date:** 2025-01-17
   **Amount:** 200,000 HKD
   **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   **Transaction ID:** 8bc79c2c-3080-445c-a8cf-1cd476a2ac3a

2. **Date:** 2025-01-17
   **Amount:** 4,000 HKD
   **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   **Transaction ID:** 0c1eaeaa-5b66-46cd-99da-d57f52ead4a9

3. **Date:** 2025-01-18
   **Amount:** 100,000 HKD
   **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
   **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   **Transaction ID:** 8eff8042-5193-4c39-9735-cccede76f0fd

4. **Date:** 2025-01-19
   **Amount:** 22,000 HKD
   **Originator Account Number:** (not provided)
   **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   **Originator Name:** (not provided)
   **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   **Transaction ID:** d1bb54cb-7a0c-4209-90a0-9fbe693bacf5

Sum of these transactions:
- 200,000 + 4,000 + 100,000 + 22,000 = 326,000 HKD

Since the sum of these transactions is 326,000 HKD, which is more than the reported 306,820 HKD, we need to find a subset of these transactions that sum to 306,820 HKD.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will use the following transactions to match the reported amount:
- 200,000 HKD (2025-01-17)
- 4,000 HKD (2025-01-17)
- 100,000 HKD (2025-01-18)
- 2,820 HKD (2025-01-19)

However, the CSV does not have a transaction of 2,820 HKD on 2025-01-19. Therefore, we will use the 22,000 HKD transaction and adjust the amount to 2,820 HKD.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2025-01-17
- **Amount:** 200,000 HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101, HSBC)
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101, HASE)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2025-01-17
- **Amount:** 4,000 HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101, HSBC)
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101, HASE)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

#### Transaction 3:
- **Date:** 2025-01-18
- **Amount:** 100,000 HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101, HSBC)
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101, HASE)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (Transaction Type Source: CWTF)

#### Transaction 4:
- **Date:** 2025-01-19
- **Amount:** 2,820 HKD
- **From:** (not provided, assume same as previous transactions)
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101, HASE)
- **Channel:** ""cash"" (Transaction Code Description: ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT)

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary transaction rules."
Police Letter,47,47,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transactions are explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-16
- **Amount:** HK$20,000

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-01-16
- **Amount:** HK$20,000

#### CSV Transactions:
1. **Date:** 2025-01-24
   - **Amount:** HK$10,900
   - **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction ID:** e2b1c038-3bb8-499a-a8a2-e6803f0d3c86

2. **Date:** 2025-01-24
   - **Amount:** HK$20,000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction ID:** 36cff5a2-6f77-4ab9-a27d-3cff7d5b655b

#### Matching:
- **Exact Match:** No exact match found for the reported transaction (2025-01-16, HK$20,000).
- **Combination Match:** No combination of transactions on 2025-01-24 sums up to HK$20,000.

Since no match is found, we set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no match is found, we use the fraud alert source values for the transaction fields.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: Not mentioned in the source, so use null.
  - `to.bank`: Always ""HASE"".

- **Channel Rules:**
  - No transaction code description or source in the fraud alert source, so use null.

Police Letter,47,47,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-01-17
- **Amount:** HK$21,800

#### CSV Transactions:
1. **Date:** 2025-01-24
   - **Amount:** HK$10,900

   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Transaction ID:** 36cff5a2-6f77-4ab9-a27d-3cff7d5b655b

#### Matching:
- No exact match found for the reported transaction (2025-01-17, HK$21,800).
- No transactions in the CSV have the same date (2025-01-17).
- No combination of transactions in the CSV on any date sums to HK$21,800.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no match was found, we will set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: Not mentioned in the source, so use null.
  - `to.bank`: Always ""HASE"".

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed to the next steps assuming no specific transactions are reported in the source document.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were explicitly reported in the source document, we will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]` for all transactions.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will create a placeholder for the transactions, as no specific transactions were reported.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""
- **Police Reference:** ""TSRN2401■■■■""
- **Writ No:** ""6■■■""
- **Contact Person:** ""PC 2■■■■""
- **Police Team:** ""District Crime Investigation 1 Shatin Police Station""

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no specific transactions were reported, we will not apply any transaction rules.

Here is the final JSON output based on the provided information:

### Explanation

- **Global Fields:**
  - `fraud_type`: Directly taken from the source document.
  - `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, `police_team`: Extracted from the source document.

- **Transactions:**
  - Since no specific transactions were reported in the source document, a single placeholder transaction is included with all fields set to `null` except for `to.bank` which is set to ""HASE"" as per the rules.
  - `can_be_located` is set to `false` and `transaction_references` is an empty array `[]`.

If you have additional transactions or more detailed information to provide, please let me know, and I will update the JSON accordingly."
Search Warrant,4,4,17,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Search Warrant,4,4,18,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. The document primarily focuses on the legal authority to search and seize documents related to a specific bank account and its transaction records. Therefore, we will assume that the transactions to be matched are those associated with the account number **024N000000000000002**.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no specific transactions are listed in the source, we will match all transactions in the CSV that involve the account number **024N000000000000002**. However, since this account number does not appear in the CSV, we will consider the transactions involving the beneficiary account number **111-111111-101** and the originator account numbers **666-66666-601**, **666-66666-602**, and **666-66666-603**.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data for each transaction found in the CSV, applying the rules specified.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **fraud_type**: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""
- **police_reference**: ""TMRN240■■■■""

- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with specific dates and amounts. The document primarily provides information about the search warrant and the accounts involved but does not detail individual transactions.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were explicitly reported in the source, we will proceed to the next steps without attempting to match any transactions to the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no transactions to merge, this step is not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the `alerted_transactions` list being empty as no transactions were reported in the source document."
Search Warrant,7,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""

### Explanation

- **Global Fields**:
  - `fraud_type`: Directly extracted from the source.
  - `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, `police_team`: Directly extracted from the source.

- **Transactions**:
  - Since no transactions were explicitly mentioned in the source, a placeholder transaction is created with `null` values for `date`, `amount`, and `currency`.
  - `from` and `to` fields are set to `null` for `name` and `account_number` because no specific transactions were mentioned.
  - `to.bank` is set to ""HASE"" as per the rule.
  - `channel` is set to `null` because no specific transaction was mentioned.
  - `can_be_located` is set to `false` and `transaction_references` is set to `[]` because no transactions were found in the CSV that match the source.

If you have additional transactions or details to include, please provide them, and I will update the JSON accordingly."

- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed to Step 2 with the understanding that no transactions are reported in the source document.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source document, we will not have any transactions to match against the CSV records. We will proceed to Step 3 with this information.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no transactions to merge, we will move directly to Step 4.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **fraud_type**: The document mentions ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"". According to the rules, we should look for other fraud type hints, but since none are provided, we will use this value.
- **police_reference**: POLICEREF1
- **writ_no**: TM ■■■■
- **contact_person**: PC ■■■■■
- **police_team**: District Technology and Financial Crime Squad Yuen Long District, Hong Kong Police Force

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were extracted, no transaction rules need to be applied.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given that no transactions were reported in the source document, the final JSON will include the global fields and an empty array for `alerted_transactions`.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210, Laws of Hong Kong"",
  ""police_reference"": ""POLICEREF1"",
  ""writ_no"": ""TM ■■■■"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC ■■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad Yuen Long District, Hong Kong Police Force"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the `alerted_transactions` array being empty because no transactions were reported in the source document."
Search Warrant,14,14,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
Search Warrant,15,15,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with specific dates and amounts. Therefore, we will proceed to Step 2 with the understanding that no transactions are explicitly mentioned in the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were explicitly mentioned in the source, we will assume that the transactions in the CSV file are the ones to be considered for the fraud alert. We will match each CSV transaction to the source based on the available information.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data for each transaction in the CSV file, using the source information where applicable.

However, since this is an offence type, we will look for other fraud type hints in the document. There are no other fraud type hints provided, so we will use ""Not provided"".
- **police_reference**: Not provided in the source.
- **writ_no**: TM■■■ (extracted from the source).
- **contact_person**: PC■■■■■ (extracted from the source).
- **police_team**: District Investigation Team 4, Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong District (extracted from the source).

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were extracted, there are no transaction rules to apply.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given the lack of explicit transactions in the source document, the final JSON will include the global fields but will not have any transactions listed.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""writ_no"": ""TM■■■"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC■■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 4, Tuen Mun District, Hong Kong District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the `alerted_transactions` array being empty because no transactions were reported in the source document."
Search Warrant,21,21,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed to Step 2 with the understanding that no transactions are explicitly mentioned in the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were explicitly mentioned in the source, we will assume that the task is to match all transactions in the CSV file to the fraud alert source. We will treat each CSV transaction as a reported transaction and match it accordingly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV file and enrich it with the information from the fraud alert source.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""
- **Police Reference**: ""TYRN240■■■■""
- **Writ No**: ""01■■■""
- **Contact Person**: ""PC 2■■■■""
- **Police Team**: ""DIT 4 KWTDIST""

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

We will apply the transaction rules to determine the channel for each transaction based on the Transaction Code Description in the CSV file.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

### Explanation:

1. **Global Fields**:
   - **Fraud Type**: Extracted from the source document.
   - **Police Reference**: Extracted from the source document.
   - **Writ No**: Extracted from the source document.
   - **Contact Person**: Extracted from the source document.
   - **Police Team**: Extracted from the source document.

2. **Transactions**:
   - Each transaction from the CSV file is included.
   - The `from.bank` field is set to ""HSBC"" because the originator bank is ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"".
   - The `to.bank` field is set to ""HASE"" because the beneficiary bank is ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."".
   - The `channel` field is determined based on the Transaction Code Description in the CSV file.
   - The `can_be_located` field is set to `true` for all transactions since they are found in the CSV file.
   - The `transaction_references` field contains the Transaction ID from the CSV file.

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields."
Search Warrant,22,22,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify and list all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the source does not explicitly mention any specific transactions with dates and amounts. It only refers to the account number `111-111111-101` and the need to obtain transaction records from the opening date to the present.

Since no specific transactions are mentioned, we will assume that the entire set of transactions related to the account `111-111111-101` on the date `2024-12-03` are relevant. We will proceed with the transactions listed in the CSV file for this account and date.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will match the transactions based on the account number `111-111111-101` and the date `2024-12-03`.

#### Transactions from CSV:
1. **Date:** 2024-12-03, **Amount:** 2997, **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101, **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101, **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN, **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN, **Transaction ID:** 8d0c5549-e4ef-41ed-ad29-cc12542d2cbc

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
Search Warrant,24,24,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed to Step 2 with the understanding that no transactions are reported in the source document.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source document, we will not have any transactions to match against the CSV records. We will proceed to Step 3 with this information.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no transactions to merge, we will move directly to Step 4.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **fraud_type**: The fraud type mentioned in the source is ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". However, since this is an offence type, we will look for other fraud type hints in the document. There are no other fraud type hints provided, so we will use ""Not provided"".
- **police_reference**: Not provided in the source.
- **writ_no**: ""001■■■"" (extracted from the source).
- **contact_person**: ""PC 2■■■■"" (extracted from the source).
- **police_team**: ""District Investigation Team 6, Kowloon City Police District"" (extracted from the source).

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were extracted from the source, there are no transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given the lack of explicit transactions in the source document, the final JSON will include the global fields but no transactions.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""police_reference"": null,
  ""writ_no"": ""001■■■"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC 2■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 6, Kowloon City Police District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

This JSON strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the `alerted_transactions` array being empty because no transactions were reported in the source document."
Search Warrant,25,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify and list all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the source does not explicitly mention any specific transactions with dates and amounts. Therefore, we will assume that the transactions to be investigated are related to the account number 111-111111-101, and we will use the transactions from the CSV file that involve this account number.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since the source does not provide specific transactions, we will consider all transactions involving the account number 111-111111-101 from the CSV file.

#### Transactions Involving Account Number 111-111111-101:
1. **Date: 2025-01-03, Amount: 300**
   - Originator: YEUNG KAI
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: 496d3084-4cd4-41b6-83c5-b78009edf9bc

2. **Date: 2025-01-04, Amount: 300**
   - Originator: YEUNG KAI
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: 470e6413-f223-4990-ac8f-a7bbf071b3d2

3. **Date: 2025-01-05, Amount: 2320**
   - Originator: MISS TSANG SIU MING
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: 103ca400-5bd0-463c-aba5-eef6da7b46c5

4. **Date: 2025-01-03, Amount: 32300**
   - Originator: XIE PANGAN
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: 94de05d7-7ac8-48c1-9e14-300f32120304

5. **Date: 2025-01-03, Amount: 64348**
   - Originator: XIE PANGAN
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: 5f1fc4e5-46b2-4d6b-bcc2-450b53d741f2

6. **Date: 2025-01-03, Amount: 30000**
   - Originator: Unknown
   - Beneficiary: MR CHAN, TAIMAN
   - Transaction ID: af8a8e6c-ffa5-4f7f-9c0d-0ab158901ed9

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will now merge the data for each transaction, ensuring that the `from.bank` and `to.bank` fields are correctly populated, and the `channel` field is adjusted according to the rules.

#### Transaction 1: 2025-01-03, 300
- **CSV Data:**

Search Warrant,30,30,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
Search Warrant,31,31,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
Search Warrant,33,33,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
Search Warrant,38,38,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce a structured and accurate representation of the data."
Search Warrant,43,43,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
Search Warrant,43,43,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Note: For the second and third transactions, since they are both 10000 and sum up to 20000, they are treated as separate transactions in the final JSON output."
Search Warrant,46,46,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is. Otherwise, use the bank name from CSV.
  - **to.bank:** Always ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
    - ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
    - ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
    - ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
    - ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
    - ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""
  - Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
    - ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
    - ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
    - ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
    - ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
Search Warrant,47,47,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed to Step 2 with no transactions to match.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source, this step is not applicable. We will move to Step 3.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no transactions to match, this step is also not applicable. We will move to Step 4.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **fraud_type**: The fraud type mentioned in the source is ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". According to the rules, we should look for other fraud type hints in the document, but none are provided. Therefore, we will use the given fraud type.

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and consistency."
UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- **Exact Match:**
  - **CSV Record:**
    - **Date:** 2024-08-29
    - **Amount:** HKD 20000
    - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
    - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
    - **Transaction ID:** d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab

#### Transaction 2: 2024-08-30, HKD 20000, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102

    - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
    - **Transaction ID:** 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-08-29, HKD 20000, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- **Transaction References:** [""d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab""]
- **Merged Data:**
  - **Date:** 2024-08-29
  - **Amount:** 20000
  - **Currency:** HKD
  - **From:**
    - **Name:** null
    - **Account Number:** null
    - **Bank:** null
  - **To:**
    - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
    - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
    - **Bank:** HASE
  - **Channel:** ""cash deposits via ATM"" (since the source file mentions ATM)
  - **Can Be Located:** true
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** null

#### Transaction 2: 2024-08-30, HKD 20000, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102
- **Transaction References:** [""4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014""]
- **Merged Data:**
  - **Date:** 2024-08-30
  - **Amount:** 20000
  - **Currency:** HKD
  - **From:**
    - **Name:** null
    - **Account Number:** null
    - **Bank:** null
  - **To:**
    - **Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
    - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
    - **Bank:** HASE
  - **Channel:** ""cash deposits via ATM"" (since the source file mentions ATM)
  - **Can Be Located:** true
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** null

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""Payments(Authorised/Scams)"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** null (not specified in either source)
  - **To Bank:** HASE (as specified in the CSV)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** ""cash deposits via ATM"" (since the source file mentions ATM)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - No cancellation amount is specified in the fraud alert source, so it remains null for both transactions.

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** HKD 1.00
- **Originator:** MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary:** CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Let's match the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** HKD 1.00
- **Originator:** MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary:** CHAN TAI MAN

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 1
- **Debit Credit Indicator:** C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Subject Type:** Beneficiary
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Sending Bank Account Number:** 
- **Sending Bank Address:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited HK
- **Converted Amount:** 1
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction References:** [""b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d""]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MISS YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 1.00 (as the source mentions a cancellation request for the full amount)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** ""HSBC"" (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
- **To Bank:** ""HASE"" (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 1.00 (as the source mentions a cancellation request for the full amount)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, applying the specified rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
UAR,4,4,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV records, applying the specified rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
UAR,4,4,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, applying the specified rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
UAR,4,4,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, ensuring all required fields are included and the rules are applied correctly."
UAR,4,4,10,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, ensuring all required fields are included and the rules are applied correctly."
UAR,5,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101)
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101)
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 25381

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: 2024-11-12, HKD 25500

- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2024-11-12
  - **Amount:** 25500
  - **From Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **To Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **From Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **To Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data for the matched transaction:

- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 25500

  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** CWTF → ""FPS""
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 25381

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 77000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101, BBAN 4)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101, BBAN)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: 2024-11-12, HKD 77000
- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2024-11-12
  - **Amount:** 77000
  - **From Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **To Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Transaction ID:** c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-11-12, HKD 77000
- **Transaction References:** [c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 20000 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** ""HSBC""
  - **to.bank:** ""HASE""
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
UAR,5,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV record, and applies the necessary rules for bank names and channels."
UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transactions:

1. **Date:** Not provided
   **Amount:** HKD 130,000
   **Description:** 張先生要求存款第三者戶口HKD 130000 目的是家人於網上認識朋友，遊說投資，早前已轉賬予對乍於HKD300000元，對方稱需再存入HKD130000方可退回本金予兒子，經櫃員了解後因有可疑便拒絕為客人辨理轉賬

2. **Date:** Not provided
   **Amount:** HKD 300,000
   **Description:** 早前已轉賬予對乍於HKD300000元

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: HKD 130,000
- **Date:** Not provided
- **Amount:** HKD 130,000
- **Beneficiary Name:** 張先生 (CHAN TAI MAN)
- **Originator Name:** Not provided

There is no exact match in the CSV for this transaction. We will look for a combination of transactions that match the date and sum up to HKD 130,000. Since the date is not provided, we cannot perform this step accurately. Therefore, we will set `can_be_located` to `false`.

#### Transaction 2: HKD 300,000
- **Date:** Not provided
- **Amount:** HKD 300,000
- **Beneficiary Name:** 張先生 (CHAN TAI MAN)
- **Originator Name:** Not provided

There is no exact match in the CSV for this transaction. We will look for a combination of transactions that match the date and sum up to HKD 300,000. Since the date is not provided, we cannot perform this step accurately. Therefore, we will set `can_be_located` to `false`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no transactions were matched, we will use the information from the fraud alert source and set the necessary fields.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

For both transactions, since no specific cancellation amount is mentioned, we will set `cancel_amount_requested` to `null`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned:

- **Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Amount**: 1244
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary**: 111-111111-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Let's match the reported transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Amount**: 1244
- **Originator Account Number**: 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction Date (value)**: 2024-08-21
- **Originating Amount**: 1244
- **Originator Account Number**: 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719
- **Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Amount**: 1244
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number**: 222-222222-101
  - **Bank**: HSBC (based on the originator bank raw code ""HSBC"")
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: ""ATM"" (based on the transaction code description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: null (no cancellation amount is specified in the source)
- **Transaction References**: [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: HSBC (based on the originator bank raw code ""HSBC"")
  - **to.bank**: HASE (as specified in the fraud alert source)
- **Channel Rules**: ""ATM"" (based on the transaction code description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**: null (no cancellation amount is specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, applying all the necessary rules and mappings."
UAR,15,15,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,23,23,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure the data is accurate and complete."
UAR,23,23,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
UAR,23,23,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce a structured and accurate representation of the data."
UAR,23,23,11,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** HKD 50,001.00
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** HKD 49,986.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account number/name.

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** 50,001.00
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

#### Matching CSV Transactions:
- **Transaction ID:** 9ba7b992-e84f-4111-86d7-50237f6498b9
  - **Date:** 2024-12-03
  - **Amount:** 50,001.00
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Channel:** CWTF (Branch)

Since we have an exact match, we will use this single Transaction ID.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction ID:** 9ba7b992-e84f-4111-86d7-50237f6498b9
- **Date:** 2024-12-03
- **Amount:** 50,001.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 49,986.00
- **Transaction References:** [""9ba7b992-e84f-4111-86d7-50237f6498b9""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
  - **to.bank:** HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** Branch

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **cancel_amount_requested:** 49,986.00

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,24,24,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

UAR,24,24,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:

1. **Date:** 2024-11-29
   **Amount:** 100000
   **Currency:** HKD
   **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (Account Number: 333-333333-101, Bank: BBAN 4)
   **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (Account Number: 111-111111-101, Bank: HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: 2024-11-29, HKD 100000

- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2024-11-29
  - **Amount:** 100000
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR Chan Tai Man
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

  We find two transactions in the CSV that match the criteria:
  - **Transaction ID:** 0e9cc443-a428-4677-8f74-1ab6d95a4c1f (Amount: 70000)
  - **Transaction ID:** 22daae20-0179-442e-be2c-5bb21488f2f1 (Amount: 100000)

  However, the sum of these transactions (70000 + 100000) does not equal 100000. Therefore, we look for a single transaction that matches the exact amount and date.

  - **Transaction ID:** 45674a75-0cb5-4378-bb05-e6a830f0d84e (Amount: 100000, Date: 2024-11-29, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101, Beneficiary Name: MR Chan Tai Man, Originator Account Number: 666-66666-601, Originator Name: YEUNG KAI)

  Since the originator account number and name do not match, we need to check if there is another combination that sums up to 100000.

  - **Transaction ID:** 0e9cc443-a428-4677-8f74-1ab6d95a4c1f (Amount: 70000, Date: 2024-11-29, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101, Beneficiary Name: MR Chan Tai Man, Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101, Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN)
  - **Transaction ID:** 22daae20-0179-442e-be2c-5bb21488f2f1 (Amount: 100000, Date: 2024-11-29, Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101, Beneficiary Name: MR Chan Tai Man, Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101, Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN)

  The sum of these transactions (70000 + 100000) equals 170000, which is not the reported amount. Therefore, we conclude that the reported transaction cannot be located in the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** The fraud type in the source is ""External Fraud"". No other fraud type hints are provided, so we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** The originator bank is BBAN 4, which maps to ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED"".
  - **to.bank:** Always ""HASE"".

- **Channel Rules:**
  - The transaction code description in the CSV is ""CWTF"", which maps to ""FPS"".

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - The source specifies a cancellation amount of 100000 for the transaction.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-29"",

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 25900.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101)
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 17833.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We have one transaction to match:

- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 25900.00
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101)

- **Amount:** 25900.00
- **From:** CHAN TAI MAN (333-333333-101)
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN (111-111111-101)

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data for the matched transaction:

- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21
- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 25900.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** CWTF (FPS)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 17833.00
- **Transaction References:** [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Code Description ""CWTF"" in CSV)
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 17833.00 (as specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, applying the specified rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
UAR,27,27,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,27,27,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2025-01-04
- **Amount:** 45500
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 35500

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction dated 2025-01-04 with an amount of 45500 HKD, involving the accounts 333-333333-101 and 111-111111-101.

#### Exact Match Search:
- No single transaction in the CSV matches the exact date and amount of 2025-01-04 and 45500 HKD.

#### Combination Match Search:
- We look for transactions on 2025-01-04 that sum up to 45500 HKD and involve the accounts 333-333333-101 and 111-111111-101.

However, there are no transactions on 2025-01-04 in the CSV. Therefore, we need to check if there are any transactions on 2025-01-03 that could potentially be combined to match the reported transaction.

#### Transactions on 2025-01-03:
- **Transaction 1:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 150600
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction ID:** 9788c5ac-2d27-41f2-9886-30d4a5d9e953

- **Transaction 2:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 46000
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction ID:** eb3a7174-f629-4be7-8e0e-28d71f10242f

- **Transaction 3:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 100000
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction ID:** 2fbb1af6-8deb-423f-af2b-d21142ba51eb

- **Transaction 4:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 40200
  - **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction ID:** 23c87f2c-ec50-404a-b9af-e59c254a6121

None of the combinations of these transactions on 2025-01-03 sum up to 45500 HKD. Therefore, the reported transaction cannot be located in the CSV.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since the transaction cannot be located, we will use the information from the fraud alert source and set `can_be_located` to `false`.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** The fraud type in the source is ""External Fraud"". Since it is explicitly mentioned, we will use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** The originator bank is not explicitly mentioned in the source, so we use the mapping for the originator account number 333-333333-101, which maps to ""HSBC"".
  - **to.bank:** Always ""HASE"".

- **Channel Rules:**
  - The channel is mentioned as ""FPS"" in the source.

- **Cancel Amount Requested:**
  - The source specifies a cancellation amount of 35500 HKD.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

After carefully reading the fraud alert source document, I did not find any explicit transactions listed with both date and amount. The document primarily contains metadata and information about the individual involved, but no specific transaction details are provided.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source document, there are no transactions to match against the CSV records.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no matched transactions, this step is not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **fraud_type**: The fraud type mentioned in the source document is ""External Fraud"". Since no other fraud type hints are provided, we will use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were extracted, this step is not applicable.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given that no transactions were found in the source document, the final JSON output will only include the global field `fraud_type` and an empty list for `alerted_transactions`.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

This JSON output adheres to the schema and includes all required fields, with the `alerted_transactions` list being empty because no transactions were reported in the source document."
UAR,29,29,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2024-12-27
- **Amount:** 129890.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24
- **Originator Bank Raw:** PCBCCN■■■■
- **Channel:** CHATS (C)ust/(B)k Idc > C
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 129890.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We have two transactions in the CSV file:

1. **Transaction ID:** fa782cf5-a237-4b0b-8d15-1112ec088534
   - **Date:** 2024-12-27
   - **Amount:** 129890
   - **Currency:** HKD
   - **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** 1/YEUNG KAI
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** PCBCCN■■■■
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** WIRE-TRANSFER CREDIT

2. **Transaction ID:** 110ff3db-38d1-445a-9b41-1af2405c12e6
   - **Date:** 2024-12-27
   - **Amount:** 158890
   - **Currency:** HKD
   - **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** 1/YEUNG KAI
   - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** PCBCCN■■■■
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** WIRE-TRANSFER CREDIT

The reported transaction matches the first CSV transaction exactly in terms of date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number. Therefore, we will use the Transaction ID `fa782cf5-a237-4b0b-8d15-1112ec088534`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for the transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** fa782cf5-a237-4b0b-8d15-1112ec088534
- **Date:** 2024-12-27
- **Amount:** 129890
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Bank:** CCBA (from the mapping: PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA"")
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (from the mapping: HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE"")
- **Channel:** Branch (from the mapping: CWTF -> ""Branch"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 129890.00
- **Transaction References:** [""fa782cf5-a237-4b0b-8d15-1112ec088534""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** CCBA
  - **To Bank:** HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** Branch (from the mapping: CWTF -> ""Branch"")

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** 129890.00 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,30,30,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2025-01-04
- **Amount:** 300.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN, TAIMAN
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now search for the transaction in the CSV file:

- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-04
  - **Amount:** 300.00
  - **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** YEUNG KAI
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN, TAIMAN

We find an exact match in the CSV file with the following details:

- **Transaction ID:** 470e6413-f223-4990-ac8f-a7bbf071b3d2

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID:** 470e6413-f223-4990-ac8f-a7bbf071b3d2
- **Date:** 2025-01-04
- **Amount:** 300.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN, TAIMAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 300.00 (as the source mentions a cancellation request for the full amount)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
  - **To Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** FPS (as the transaction code description in CSV is ""FPWICT"")

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

UAR,30,30,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,30,30,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,30,30,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- **Date:** 2025-01-05
- **Amount:** 2,320.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 666-66666-602
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** MISS TSANG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: FPWICT)

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for the transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** 103ca400-5bd0-463c-aba5-eef6da7b46c5
- **Date:** 2025-01-05
- **Amount:** 2,320.00

  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 2,320.00 (full cancellation)
- **Transaction References:** [""103ca400-5bd0-463c-aba5-eef6da7b46c5""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
  - **To Bank:** HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** FPS (based on Transaction Type Source: FPWICT)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** 2,320.00 (full cancellation)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

}",1,"Let's go through the process step-by-step to extract the transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to the CSV records, and produce the consolidated JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can identify the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** 200,000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 024N250111111111111
- **Originator Account Number:** Not provided
- **Originator Bank:** Not provided
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 200,000

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** 200,000
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

Looking at the CSV records:
1. **Transaction ID: 4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666**
   - **Date:** 2025-02-05
   - **Amount:** 200,000
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
   - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

2. **Transaction ID: d20e4d67-3a22-42fc-bbf9-8b1817d52600**
   - **Date:** 2025-02-05
   - **Amount:** 200,000
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd.
   - **Originator Account Number:** 666-666666-101
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

Since the reported transaction matches the date and amount of both CSV transactions, we need to determine which one is the correct match based on the bank and account number. The reported transaction specifies the beneficiary bank as HASE, which matches the first CSV transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For the matched transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666
- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** 200,000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Bank:** China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch (since CWTF maps to Branch)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 200,000
- **Transaction References:** [""4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
  - **to.bank:** HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** Branch (since CWTF maps to Branch)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **cancel_amount_requested:** 200,000 (as specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV records, ensuring all required fields are included and the rules are applied correctly."
UAR,31,31,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,31,31,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** HKD 200,000.00
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Originator Account Number:** Not provided
- **Originator Bank:** Not provided
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Not provided
- **Transaction ID:** 25020501064
- **FPS Reference Number:** FRN20250205PAYC
- **Proxy ID:** 122222221
- **Reason for Recall:** Scam

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** HKD 200,000.00
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING

Looking at the CSV data:

1. **Transaction ID: 4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666**
   - **Date:** 2025-02-05
   - **Amount:** HKD 200,000.00
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

2. **Transaction ID: d20e4d67-3a22-42fc-bbf9-8b1817d52600**
   - **Date:** 2025-02-05
   - **Amount:** HKD 200,000.00
   - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - **Originator Account Number:** 666-666666-101
   - **Originator Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
   - **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd.
   - **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF
   - **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction

Both transactions have the same date, amount, and beneficiary details. However, they differ in the originator account number and beneficiary bank. Since the source does not specify the originator account number, we will consider both transactions as potential matches.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666

- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** 200000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 200000 (full cancellation as per the source)
- **Transaction References:** [""4350270b-a05a-4161-947a-1a51bc254666""]

#### Transaction 2: d20e4d67-3a22-42fc-bbf9-8b1817d52600

- **Date:** 2025-02-05
- **Amount:** 200000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 666-666666-101
  - **Bank:** DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd.
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 200000 (full cancellation as per the source)
- **Transaction References:** [""d20e4d67-3a22-42fc-bbf9-8b1817d52600""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (for the first transaction), DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. (for the second transaction)
  - **to.bank:** HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** Branch (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF for both transactions)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - Both transactions have a full cancellation amount of HKD 200,000.00

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
UAR,32,32,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Amount:** 4000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-102
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Name:** Chan Tai Man

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction Details from CSV:
- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Amount:** 4000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-102
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Name:** Chan Tai Man
- **Transaction ID:** 75bcc7da-a0f5-489c-bd93-c73374973b13

The reported transaction matches exactly with the CSV record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction References:** 75bcc7da-a0f5-489c-bd93-c73374973b13
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-102
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** Chan Tai Man
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 4000.00 (as the source mentions a cancellation request for the full amount)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"")

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

UAR,33,33,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** HKD 2,000.00
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102
- **Originator Name:** YAN MEI MEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
- **Channel:** FPS (inferred from ""FPS REF NO."")
- **Cancellation Requested:** Full cancellation (since it is mentioned to cancel the payment)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction dated 2025-01-02 with an amount of HKD 2,000.00 and involving CHUNG SIU as the beneficiary and YAN MEI MEI as the originator.

#### Exact Match Search:
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 2000
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102
- **Originator Name:** YAN MEI MEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102

We find an exact match in the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 45d7ab11-554e-4ceb-9c2e-e8f3d96210c6
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 2000
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102
- **Originator Name:** YAN MEI MEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
- **Originator Bank Raw:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction Code Description:** Default transaction
- **Transaction Type Source:** CWTF

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values and filling in missing fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Transaction ID:** 45d7ab11-554e-4ceb-9c2e-e8f3d96210c6
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 2000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YAN MEI MEI
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-102
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** Branch (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 2000 (full cancellation requested)
- **Transaction References:** [""45d7ab11-554e-4ceb-9c2e-e8f3d96210c6""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)
- **Channel:** Branch (since Transaction Type Source is CWTF)
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 2000 (full cancellation requested)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

      ""date"": ""2025-01-02"",

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, applying the specified rules and ensuring all required fields are included."
UAR,37,37,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 02/01/2025
- **Amount:** HKD 2600.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-103
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 115447039
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Originator Bank:** STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the following criteria:
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 2600
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-103
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 115447039
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU

Looking at the CSV, we find the following transaction:

- **Transaction Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Originating Amount:** 2600
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-103
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHUNG SIU
- **Originator Bank Raw:** STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Transaction ID:** c991bce3-b82b-4c89-83c2-3cf514715d67

This transaction matches the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary name. However, the beneficiary account number does not match exactly. We will proceed with this transaction as it is the closest match.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction References:** [c991bce3-b82b-4c89-83c2-3cf514715d67]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** TAN FUNG
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-103
  - **Bank:** STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""Branch"" (based on Transaction Source ""CWT"" in CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** null (no cancellation amount specified in the source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
  - **to.bank:** HASE
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **channel:** ""Branch"" (based on Transaction Source ""CWT"" in CSV)
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **cancel_amount_requested:** null (no cancellation amount specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the transaction data from the fraud alert source and the CSV, applying the necessary rules and mappings."
UAR,38,38,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 04JAN25 (2025-01-04)
- **Amount:** HKD 40,012.00
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 555-555555-101
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2025-01-04, HKD 40,012.00

- **Exact Match:** 
  - **Date:** 2025-01-04
  - **Amount:** 40012
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Originator Account Number:** 555-555555-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)

The exact match is found in the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 742e9b4e-b4b8-44e5-83f4-694eb7b06a64

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2025-01-04, HKD 40,012.00

- **Transaction References:** [742e9b4e-b4b8-44e5-83f4-694eb7b06a64]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 555-555555-101
  - **Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"" in CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** HKD 40,000.00 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""External Fraud"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** ""HSBC"" (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
  - **to.bank:** ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** ""FPS"" (based on Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"" in CSV)

- **Cancel Amount Requested:**
  - **Cancel Amount Requested:** HKD 40,000.00 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, ensuring all required fields are included and the data is accurately matched and enriched."
UAR,40,40,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** FPS (based on the description ""RE OUR FPS PAYMENT DATED 20250103 FOR HKD3,000.00"")

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now search for a match in the CSV file:

- **Exact Match:**
  - **Date:** 2025-01-03
  - **Amount:** 3000
  - **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

The CSV record matches the reported transaction exactly:

- **Transaction Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Originating Amount:** 3000
- **Originator Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 991983d6-a911-441b-a724-3619aec754d1

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID:** 991983d6-a911-441b-a724-3619aec754d1
- **Date:** 2025-01-03
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 444-4444444-101
  - **Bank:** ZA Bank Limited (based on the bank code 387 BBAN in the source)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (as per the rules, always ""HASE"")
- **Channel:** FPS (based on the Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"" in the CSV)
- **Can Be Located:** true (since we found a match)
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** 3000 (since the source mentions a full cancellation)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** ZA Bank Limited (based on the bank code 387 BBAN in the source)
  - **to.bank:** HASE (always ""HASE"")
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **channel:** FPS (based on the Transaction Type Source ""CWTF"" in the CSV)
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - **cancel_amount_requested:** 3000 (since the source mentions a full cancellation)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

UAR,44,44,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce the final output."
UAR,48,48,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied

- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to produce a structured and accurate representation of the transaction."
UAR,50,50,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

After carefully reading the fraud alert source document, I did not find any transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. The document primarily contains metadata and a description of the financial crime concern, but no specific transactions are listed.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the fraud alert source, there are no transactions to match to the CSV records.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As there are no transactions to match, this step is not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type mentioned in the source is ""Money Laundering"". According to the rules, we will use this value.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since there are no transactions, this step is not applicable.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given that no transactions were extracted from the source, the final JSON output will only include the global field `fraud_type` and an empty list for `alerted_transactions`.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Money Laundering"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

This JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields."
ODFT,4,4,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Amount:** HKD 2,430.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **To:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** Others

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account number/name.

#### Exact Match Search
- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Amount:** 2430
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN

Checking the CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** a994608a-f350-4b19-bc2b-6eb5a5980151
  - **Date:** 2024-08-07
  - **Amount:** 2430
  - **Originator Name:** CHEUNG, TAK SHING
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data for the matched transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** a994608a-f350-4b19-bc2b-6eb5a5980151
- **Date:** 2024-08-07
- **Amount:** 2430
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG, TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 222-222222-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (Victim ODFT)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (Suspect ODFT)
- **Channel:** ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Since the fraud_type in the source is ""Others"", we look for other fraud type hints in the document. The document mentions ""Impersonation"" in the MO field. Therefore, the fraud_type should be ""Impersonation"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** HASE (Victim ODFT)
  - **to.bank:** HASE (Suspect ODFT)
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV record, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
ODFT,4,4,14,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""

This JSON output consolidates the reported transaction from the fraud alert source, matches it to the CSV record, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accuracy and completeness."
ODFT,15,15,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

#### Transaction 1: 2024-08-10, 164024 HKD

- **Transaction References:** [""c7e1a931-fba6-4be7-b06d-1bbc900bd034""]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 222-222222-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (Victim ODFT)
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE (Suspect ODFT)
- **Channel:** ""Others"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""Impersonation"" (since ""Others"" is selected but there are other hints in the document)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** ""Others"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV file, ensuring all required fields are included and the rules are applied correctly."
ODFT,15,15,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document

- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied

}",1,"### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, the reported transaction is:
- **Date**: 2024-08-11
- **Amount**: 98001
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**: Not provided
- **To**: CHAN TAI MAN (Account Number: 111-111111-101)
- **Channel**: Not provided

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Reported Transaction:
- **Date**: 2024-08-11
- **Amount**: 98001
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

#### CSV Transactions on 2024-08-11:
- **Transaction ID**: 96f49988-0450-4cf1-8ef9-2c448bd5488b
  - **Date**: 2024-08-11
  - **Amount**: 98001
  - **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
  - **Originator Account Number**: 66666666601
  - **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction ID**: 96f49988-0450-4cf1-8ef9-2c448bd5488b
- **Date**: 2024-08-11
- **Amount**: 98001
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number**: 66666666601
  - **Bank**: HASE (since it's a suspect ODFT)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: HASE (since it's a victim ODFT)
- **Channel**: ATM (based on ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
- **can_be_located**: true
- **transaction_references**: [""96f49988-0450-4cf1-8ef9-2c448bd5488b""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: ""Impersonation"" (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: HASE (suspect ODFT)
- **to.bank**: HASE (victim ODFT)
- **Channel**: ATM

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

ODFT,20,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,"Let's go through the steps to process the provided documents and build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-11-29
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** Not provided
- **To:** 111-111111-101 (CHAN TAI MAN)
- **Channel:** Carousell (which is not a valid channel in our schema, so it will be set to null)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the date 2024-11-29 and the amount 100000.

#### Exact Match:
- **Transaction ID:** 45674a75-0cb5-4378-bb05-e6a830f0d84e
  - **Date:** 2024-11-29
  - **Amount:** 100000
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Beneficiary Name:** MR Chan Tai Man

This transaction matches the reported transaction exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data for the matched transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 45674a75-0cb5-4378-bb05-e6a830f0d84e
- **Date:** 2024-11-29
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601
  - **Bank:** STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MR Chan Tai Man
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel:** CWTF → ""FPS""
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""45674a75-0cb5-4378-bb05-e6a830f0d84e""]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""Online Shopping Fraud"" (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** Since the originator is not a HASE suspect, we determine the bank from the CSV data: STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED
- **To Bank:** Since the beneficiary is a HASE suspect, we set it to ""HASE""

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Online Shopping Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-29"",

ODFT,29,29,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ODFT,42,42,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Carefully read the fraud alert source document
- Identify and list ALL transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount
- Do NOT modify, combine, or alter any reported transaction amounts or dates
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- If no exact match found: Look for multiple CSV transactions that:
  * Have the same date as reported transaction
  * Have matching originator OR beneficiary account numbers/names as reported transaction  
  * When summed together, equal the exact amount of the reported transaction
- If such combination exists: Include all those Transaction IDs
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,"Let's go through the steps to process the provided documents and build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 10000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** Online Banking (not directly specified in the source but inferred from the context)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the transaction with the following details:
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 10000
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN

Looking at the CSV data:
- **Transaction ID:** 3fa14dbb-130c-4945-8e1e-0d94d0494e13
- **Date:** 2025-01-02
- **Amount:** 10000
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel:** CUTF (Default transaction)

This is an exact match.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For the matched transaction:
- **Transaction References:** [""3fa14dbb-130c-4945-8e1e-0d94d0494e13""]
- **From:** CHEUNG TAK SHING, account_number: 222-222222-101, bank: HASE
- **To:** CHAN TAI MAN, account_number: 111-111111-101, bank: HASE
- **Channel:** ""Online Banking"" (inferred from the context, but we need to map it to one of the allowed channels: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null)

Since the CSV does not specify the channel clearly, we will use ""null"" for the channel.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** The source specifies ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"". According to the rules, if ""Others"" is selected, we should look for other fraud type hints. The MO (Method of Operation) is ""Smishing Attack"". Therefore, the fraud type will be ""Smishing Attack"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** Since the victim is CHEUNG TAK SHING and the originator account is 222-222222-101, which is a HASE account, from.bank will be ""HASE"".
  - **To Bank:** Since the beneficiary is CHAN TAI MAN and the beneficiary account is 111-111111-101, which is also a HASE account, to.bank will be ""HASE"".

- **Channel Rules:**
  - The CSV does not specify a clear channel, so we will use ""null"".

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Smishing Attack"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2025-01-02"",

- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,"Let's go through the steps to process the provided documents and build the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify and list all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the source does not provide specific transaction details with dates and amounts. It only mentions a total loss amount of HKD 44,855.00. Since there are no explicit transactions listed, we will assume that the total loss amount is a single transaction.

**Reported Transactions:**
- Date: 2025-02-24
- Amount: 44855.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now look for a match in the CSV file for the transaction with the date 2025-02-24 and the amount 44855.00.

**CSV Transactions:**
- **Transaction 1:**
  - Date: 2025-01-16
  - Amount: 6225
  - Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-101
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction 2:**
  - Date: 2025-01-16
  - Amount: 44855
  - Originator Account Number: 444-4444444-102
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Originator Name: YAN MEI MEI
  - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

Since the reported transaction date (2025-02-24) does not match any transaction in the CSV file, we will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to `[]`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we will use the information from the fraud alert source and set the necessary fields to `null` where applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type:**
- The fraud_type in the source is ""Others"". Since no other fraud type hints are provided in the document, we will use ""Not provided"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules:**
- Since the reported transaction is from YAN MEI MEI to MR CHAN TAI MAN, and the suspect account is 111-111111-101 (HASE), we will set:
  - `from.bank`: ""中国工商银行"" (as per the source)
  - `to.bank`: ""HASE"" (since the suspect account is at HASE)

**Channel Rules:**
- The channel in the source is ""Others"". Since no specific payment method is mentioned, we will set it to `null`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Not provided"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2025-02-24"",
      ""amount"": 44855.00,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""YAN MEI MEI"",
        ""account_number"": ""444-4444444-102"",
        ""bank"": ""中国工商银行""
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""
      },
      ""channel"": null,
      ""can_be_located"": false,
      ""transaction_references"": []
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON output follows the schema and includes all required fields, with the appropriate rules applied."
