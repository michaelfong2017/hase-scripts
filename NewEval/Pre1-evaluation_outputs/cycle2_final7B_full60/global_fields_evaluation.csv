ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount.

- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 192500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**:CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 66666666601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Remitting Bank**: BOC
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HSB

So, the extracted transaction is:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
  ""amount"": 192500,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
    ""account_number"": ""66666666601"",
    ""bank"": ""BOC""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HSB""
  },
  ""channel"": null,
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff""]
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

- **Exact Match Criteria**: Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

From the CSV file, we find the following transaction:

```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2024-10-07,HKD,192500,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited,66666666601,111-111111-101,YEUNG KAI,CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited    HK,192500,9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
```

This matches the extracted transaction perfectly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the CSV data into the extracted transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 192500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 66666666601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Remitting Bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS (as per Transaction Code Description CWTF)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the transaction rules:

- **Channel**: FPS (as per Transaction Code Description CWTF)
- **From Bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To Bank**: HSB (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- **Channel**: FPS

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Social Media Deception
- **Police Reference**: E-HUB-■■■
- **Police Team**: E-HUB-■■■

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the data, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Social Media Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""E-HUB-■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""E-HUB-■■■"",

HSBC Referral,3,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions as per the given specifications.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the following details:
- Date: `2024-11-12`
- Amount: `25,500.00` (converted to `25500.00`)
- Originator Account Number: `333-333333-101`
- Originator Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
- Originator Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",
  ""amount"": 25500.00,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""333-333333-101"",
    ""bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""NIL"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03""]
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find the exact match for the above transaction in the CSV records.

#### Matching Criteria:
- Date: `2024-11-12`
- Amount: `25500.00`
- Originator Account Number: `333-333333-101`
- Originator Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- Originator Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`

#### Matching the Transaction:
The transaction in the CSV matches the criteria:
- Date: `2024-11-12`
- Amount: `25500.00`
- Originator Account Number: `333-333333-101`
- Originator Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- Originator Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the CSV values:
- Channel: `CWTF` -> `FPS`
- Beneficiary Name: `CHAN TAI MAN`
- Beneficiary Account Number: `NIL`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- From Bank: `The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited` -> `HSBC`
- To Bank: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.` -> `HASE`
- Channel: `CWTF` -> `FPS`

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps outlined to extract and process the transactions from the given fraud alert source and CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions explicitly mentioned:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: HKD50,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: HKD56,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find matches in the CSV file based on the criteria:

- **Transaction 1:**
  - Date: 2024-11-12
  - Amount: HKD50,000.00
  - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

  Matching the CSV:
  - Found match: `Transaction ID: 191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab`

- **Transaction 2:**
  - Date: 2024-11-12
  - Amount: HKD56,000.00
  - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

  Matching the CSV:
  - Found match: `Transaction ID: bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data for each matched transaction.

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 50000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab]

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 56000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** FPS
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [bf09dff6-4fa6-4ad9-8767-2ecbac3572a5]

HSBC Referral,5,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

   - Amount: 90,000.00 HKD
   - Originator Account Number: 555-555555-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 222-222222-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find matches for these transactions in the CSV file.

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 93,000.00 HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101

- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

From the CSV, we find the matching transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-01-10
- **Amount:** 90,000.00 HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101

HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the data into the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 200,000.00
   - Originator Account: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 100,000.00
   - Originator Account: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will search for exact matches based on the extracted transactions.

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 200,000.00
- **Originator Account:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

From the CSV, we find:
- **Transaction ID:** 7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR        CHAN TAI MAN

This matches the criteria.

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 100,000.00
- **Originator Account:** 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

From the CSV, we find:
- **Transaction ID:** fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR        CHAN TAI MAN

This matches the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- **Transaction ID:** 7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 200,000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** CWTF
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8]

#### Transaction 2:
- **Transaction ID:** fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 100,000.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 333-333333-101

  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** CWTF
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Both transactions use the same rules:
- **Bank Rules:**
  - **from.bank:** HSBC
  - **to.bank:** HASE
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** CWTF

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the data from the fraud alert source and the CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source:
- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: HKD20,000
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-25"",
  ""amount"": 20000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
    ""account_number"": ""666-66666-601"",
    ""bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
  },
  ""channel"": null,
  ""can_be_located"": false,
  ""transaction_references"": []
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

From the CSV file, we look for:
- Date: 2024-08-25
- Amount: 20,000 HKD
- Originator Account Number: 666-66666-601
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Originator Name: YEUNG KAI
- Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Matching the above criteria, there is no exact match in the CSV file. Hence, `can_be_located` is set to `false`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we will use the extracted transaction details directly.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No specific transaction rules were applied since no exact match was found.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Given the extracted and processed data, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": null,
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-25"",

HSBC Referral,25,25,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:

  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the data as specified.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

- **Date:** `2024-08-28`
- **Amount:** `50000`
- **Originator Bank:** `NA CASH`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `CHUNG SIU`

So, the extracted transaction is:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": ""NA CASH""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHUNG SIU"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""channel"": ""cash"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]
}
```

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We now match this transaction to the CSV records:

- **Date:** `2024-08-28`
- **Amount:** `50000`
- **Originator Bank:** `NA CASH`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `CHUNG SIU`

From the CSV, we find the following match:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": ""NA CASH""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MR    CHUNG SIU"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""channel"": ""cash"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]
}
```

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling missing fields with fraud alert source values:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
  ""amount"": 50000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": ""NA CASH""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MR    CHUNG SIU"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""channel"": ""cash"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]
}
```

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Since the originator bank is `NA CASH`, we apply the cash transaction rule:

- **Channel:** `cash`
- **From.bank:** `null`
- **From.name:** `null` (if it was the cash reference)

The transaction remains unchanged.

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

#### **Police Reference Rules:**

Extract the full police reference from the source document:

- **Police Reference:** `TSW RN 240■■■■■■■`

Exclude police team information:

- **Police Team:** `District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District`

#### **Fraud Type:**

Based on the description, the fraud type is:

- **Fraud Type:** `Investment Scam`

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Combining all the extracted and processed data:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Investment Scam"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSW RN 240■■■■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-28"",
      ""amount"": 50000,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": null,
        ""account_number"": null,
        ""bank"": ""NA CASH""
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""MR    CHUNG SIU"",
        ""account_number"": ""111-111111-102"",
        ""bank"": null
      },
      ""channel"": ""cash"",
      ""can_be_located"": true,
      ""transaction_references"": [""3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6""]
    }
  ]
}
```

Police Letter,9,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""police_reference"": ""string | null"",

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the necessary information from the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the following transactions:

- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Bank and Account:** Cash Deposit
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

This gives us one transaction to match against the CSV.

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find an exact match for the transaction in the CSV.

- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Originator Bank and Account:** Cash Deposit
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV, we find the following row:

```
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

```

This matches perfectly. So, the `Transaction ID` for this transaction is `bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1`.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Now, let's merge the data from the CSV and the fraud alert source:

- **Date:** 2024-07-25
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** (Not provided in the CSV)
  - **Account Number:** (Not provided in the CSV)
  - **Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED

- **Channel:** ""cash""
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [""bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1""]

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Channel:** ""cash""
- **From.Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **To.Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Fraud Type:** Romance Scam

Police Letter,10,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps to process the provided documents and extract the relevant transactions from the CSV file, then match and consolidate the data according to the specified rules.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. Here are the relevant details:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-05-22
   - Amount: 3000
   - Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
   - Originator Account: 222-222222-101
   - Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - Beneficiary Name:CHAN TAI MAN

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-05-22
   - Amount: 50000
   - Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-103
   - Originator Account: (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
   - Originator Name: (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
   - Beneficiary Name: CHIU YAN

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We will now match these transactions to the CSV records.

#### **Matching Transaction 1:**
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Account:** 222-222222-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN

From the CSV:
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Account:** 222-222222-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a

This matches perfectly, so we use the Transaction ID `7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a`.

#### **Matching Transaction 2:**
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-103
- **Originator Account:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
- **Originator Name:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU YAN

From the CSV:
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Beneficiary Account:** 111-111111-103
- **Originator Account:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
- **Originator Name:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHIU YAN
- **Transaction ID:** ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6

This matches perfectly, so we use the Transaction ID `ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6`.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

#### **Transaction 1:**
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 3000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - **Account Number:** 222-222222-101
  - **Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **Channel:** ATM
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a]

#### **Transaction 2:**
- **Date:** 2024-05-22
- **Amount:** 50000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
  - **Account Number:** (not explicitly given, but inferred from context)
  - **Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **To:**
  - **Name:** CHIU YAN
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-103
  - **Bank:** HANG SENG BANK, LIMITED
- **Channel:** cash
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6]

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

#### **Transaction 1:**
- **Channel:** ATM

#### **Transaction 2:**
- **Channel:** cash

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

#### **Police Reference Rules:**
- **Police Reference:** Policeref1

#### **Police Team Rules:**
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 4, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Police Letter,11,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP TSANG ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Police Letter,12,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the reported transactions. Here are the relevant details:

- **Date:** `2024-07-15`
- **Amount:** `40000`
- **Originator Account:** `111-111111-101`

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find the corresponding transaction in the CSV file. Let's match the extracted transaction:

- **Date:** `2024-07-15`

Search Warrant,6,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Given the provided fraud alert source and the structure of the CSV file, let's proceed through the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify any transactions explicitly mentioned. However, the provided text does not contain any specific transactions with dates and amounts. Therefore, we assume there are no explicit transactions mentioned in this source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, there are no transactions to match to the CSV file. Hence, we move to the next step.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no transactions were matched, this step is not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were matched, this step is not applicable.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

We will apply the global field rules based on the provided fraud alert source:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""KTRN230■■■■"",
  ""writ_no"": ""8■■■"",
  ""contact_person"": ""PC 1■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force""
}
```

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Since no transactions were extracted, matched, or merged, the final JSON will only include the global fields:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""KTRN230■■■■"",

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the source does not provide specific transactions with dates and amounts. Therefore, we will proceed with the transactions provided in the CSV file.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will search for exact matches based on the given criteria:
- Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

Since there are no specific transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source, we will assume that all transactions in the CSV file could potentially be relevant. We will go through each transaction in the CSV and see if it matches the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For each matched transaction, we will extract the `transaction_references` from the CSV, use the CSV values for all transaction fields, and fill in missing fields with the fraud alert source values where applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

We will apply the rules for bank names, channels, and other fields.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

We will apply the rules for `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

We will build the final JSON output based on the above steps.

#### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

Since no specific transactions are mentioned in the fraud alert source, we will proceed with the CSV transactions.

#### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will match each transaction in the CSV to see if it fits the criteria.

#### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV into the structure required by the JSON schema.

#### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

We will apply the rules for bank names, channels, and other fields.

#### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

We will apply the rules for `fraud_type`, `police_reference`, `writ_no`, `contact_person`, and `police_team`.

#### Step 6: Build Final JSON

We will build the final JSON output.

Here is the final JSON output:

Search Warrant,25,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract any reported transactions. However, the source does not explicitly mention any specific transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed without extracting any transactions for now.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we cannot perform this step.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Since no transactions were matched, this step is also not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Since no transactions were extracted or matched, this step is not applicable.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We will extract the global fields from the fraud alert source and apply the necessary rules.

#### Fraud Type Rules
The fraud type mentioned in the document is ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". This is an offense type, so we will use this as the fraud type.

#### Police Reference Rules
The police reference is `TSWRN240■■■■`.

#### Police Team Rules
The police team is `District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Given the lack of specific transactions, we will create a JSON structure with the extracted global fields.

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSWRN240■■■■"",

  ""contact_person"": ""SGT 2■■■■"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

Since no specific transactions were reported in the fraud alert source, the final JSON output includes the extracted global fields without any transactions.",2270.0,460.0,"{

UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the transactions based on the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions described in chronological order:
- 8月29日 12:08 存入HKD20000 至 111-111111-101
- 8月30日 16:32 存入HKD20000 至 111-111111-102

We will extract these transactions from the CSV file.

#### Extracted Transactions:
1. **Transaction Date**: 2024-08-29
   - **Amount**: 20000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
   - **Originator Name**: MR       CHAN TAI MAN

2. **Transaction Date**: 2024-08-30
   - **Amount**: 20000
   - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-102
   - **Originator Name**: MR   CHUNG SIU

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We will now match these transactions to the CSV records.

#### Matching Process:
- **Transaction 1**:
  - **Date**: 2024-08-29
  - **Amount**: 20000
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Originator Name**: MR       CHAN TAI MAN

  Matching with CSV:
  - Found exact match: `Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab`

- **Transaction 2**:
  - **Date**: 2024-08-30
  - **Amount**: 20000
  - **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-102
  - **Originator Name**: MR   CHUNG SIU

  Matching with CSV:
  - Found exact match: `Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014`

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

We will merge the data from the CSV records into the extracted transactions.

#### Merged Data:
1. **Transaction 1**:
   - **Date**: 2024-08-29
   - **Amount**: 20000
   - **Currency**: HKD
   - **From**:
     - **Name**: MR       CHAN TAI MAN
     - **Account Number**: Not provided in CSV
     - **Bank**: Not provided in CSV
   - **To**:
     - **Name**: MR       CHAN TAI MAN
     - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
     - **Bank**: HASE
   - **Channel**: ATM
   - **Can Be Located**: true
   - **Transaction References**: [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]
   - **Cancel Amount Requested**: null

2. **Transaction 2**:
   - **Date**: 2024-08-30
   - **Amount**: 20000
   - **Currency**: HKD
   - **From**:
     - **Name**: MR   CHUNG SIU
     - **Account Number**: Not provided in CSV
     - **Bank**: Not provided in CSV
   - **To**:
     - **Name**: MR   CHUNG SIU
     - **Account Number**: 111-111111-102
     - **Bank**: HASE
   - **Channel**: ATM
   - **Can Be Located**: true
   - **Transaction References**: [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]
   - **Cancel Amount Requested**: null

### **Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

#### Fraud Type Rule:
- Given the fraud type is ""External Fraud"", we will use this as it matches the fraud type in the source document.

#### Final JSON Output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

UAR,3,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and process the transactions from the given fraud alert source and CSV file.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the relevant transaction details. Here's the information we can extract:

- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: HKD 1.00
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Transaction ID**: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find a match in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: HKD 1.00
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV file, we find a matching transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-07-10
- **Amount**: 1.00
- **Originator Name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Transaction ID**: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- **Transaction References**: [b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d]
- **from.name**: MISS YEUNG KAI
- **from.account_number**: 666-66666-601
- **from.bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **to.name**: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **to.account_number**: 111-111111-101
- **to.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **channel**: CWTF
- **can_be_located**: true
- **cancel_amount_requested**: 1.00
- **currency**: HKD

### **Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (matches the fraud type in the fraud alert source)

### **Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (matches the bank name in the source)
  - **to.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (matches the bank name in the source)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - **channel**: CWTF (matches the channel in the source)

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**:
  - The fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount of HKD 1.00, so `cancel_amount_requested` is set to 1.00.

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the data from the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
We need to extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount from the fraud alert source.

From the given fraud alert source:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: HKD77,000.00
- **Transaction ID**: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

So, the extracted transaction is:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",
  ""amount"": 77000,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""333-333333-101"",
    ""bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": 20000,
  ""transaction_references"": [""c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432""]
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a match in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

From the CSV:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 77000
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

The transaction in the CSV that matches these details is:
- **Transaction ID**: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Using the matched CSV transaction, we merge the data as follows:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 77000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**: 
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 333-333333-101
  - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **To**: 
  - **Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 20000
- **Transaction References**: [c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **To Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel Rules**: FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the above information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",
      ""amount"": 77000,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""333-333333-101"",
        ""bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited""
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""MR        CHAN TAI MAN"",

UAR,5,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps outlined to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions into the required JSON format.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
We need to extract transactions with both date and amount from the fraud alert source.

From the fraud alert source:
- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 19,990.00
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Bank Codes**:
  - **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

The extracted transaction:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-11-11"",
  ""amount"": 19990.0,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""333-333333-101"",
    ""bank"": ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MR CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": 19990.0,
  ""transaction_references"": [""47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7""]
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

From the CSV file, we see the following transaction matches the criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 19990.00
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

This matches the extracted transaction perfectly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We merge the CSV data with the extracted transaction details:
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 19990.0

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (matches the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **to.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel Rules**: FPS
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**: 19990.0

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
The final JSON output is:
```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-11"",
      ""amount"": 19990.0,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",

UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps to process the given documents and extract the relevant information.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the provided document does not contain explicit transaction details. Instead, it describes a case where a customer (CHAN TAI MAN) attempted to transfer funds to a third party (YEUNG KAI). We need to infer the transaction details from the description.

Given the description:
- **Amount**: HKD 300,000 (initial transfer) + HKD 130,000 (attempted additional transfer)
- **Date**: Not explicitly provided, but we can use the date of the initial transaction for inference.
- **From**: TSANG SIU MING (the reporting employee)
- **To**: YEUNG KAI (third party)

Since the CSV file contains a single transaction, we'll use that for our consolidation.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We have one transaction in the CSV file:
- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 192,500 HKD
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank Raw**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 66666666601
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID**: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff

We need to match this transaction to the reported case. The beneficiary name matches, but the originator name does not. This suggests that the reported transaction is not the one we're looking for. Given the context, we should consider the transaction as a reference and proceed with the rules.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since we don't have a perfect match, we will use the CSV transaction details and fill in the missing fields based on the fraud alert source.

#### Merged Data:
- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 192,500 HKD
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: YEUNG KAI
  - **Account Number**: 66666666601
  - **Bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To**:
  - **Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number**: 111-111111-101
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: CWTF (FPS)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 130,000 HKD (since it was attempted)
- **Transaction References**: [9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- The fraud type is ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- **From**:
  - **Bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To**:
  - **Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

#### Channel Rules:
- **Channel**: CWTF (FPS)

#### Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 130,000 HKD

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ],
      ""cancel_amount_requested"": null
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the provided documents and CSV file.

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the relevant transaction details:
- Date: 2024-08-21
- Amount: 1244
- Currency: HKD
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Chan Tai Man
- Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

The extracted transaction is:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-21"",
  ""amount"": 1244,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
  ""transaction_references"": [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]
}
```

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We have one transaction extracted. Now, let's match it to the CSV data:
- Date: 2024-08-21
- Amount: 1244
- Currency: HKD
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Chan Tai Man
- Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

Matching this with the CSV data:
- Date: 2024-08-21
- Amount: 1244
- Currency: HKD
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Chan Tai Man
- Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT
- Transaction ID: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

The transaction matches perfectly. So, we proceed to merge the data.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Using the CSV data, we merge the transaction details:
- `from.bank`: Since the originator bank is not specified in the CSV, we use the bank name from the fraud alert source, which is HASE.
- `to.bank`: The beneficiary bank is not specified in the CSV, so we use ""HASE"".
- `channel`: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT → ""ATM""

The merged transaction details are:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-08-21"",
  ""amount"": 1244,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""222-222222-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""HASE""
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
  ""transaction_references"": [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]
}
```

### **Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

Global field (fraud_type):
- The fraud type is ""External Fraud"". No other hints are provided, so we use ""External Fraud"".

### **Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

#### **Bank Rules:**
- `from.bank`: From the fraud alert source, we determine that the bank is HASE.
- `to.bank`: From the fraud alert source, we determine that the bank is HASE.

#### **Channel Rules:**
- The transaction code description is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM"".

#### **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
- No cancellation amount is specified, so `cancel_amount_requested` is `null`.

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:
```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-21"",
      ""amount"": 1244,

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: 25900.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR        CHAN TAI MAN

#### Matching Result:
- **Exact Match Found**: The transaction in the CSV matches the extracted transaction details.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Transaction References**: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]
- **Originator**: 
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary**: 
  - Name: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel**: FPS (since `Transaction Type Source` is `CWTF`)
- **Amount**: 25900.00
- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 17833.00 (as specified in the document)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (matches the fraud type in the document)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - **to.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Channel Rules**: FPS (as determined from the CSV)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the provided documents and extract the relevant transactions.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions that match the criteria:
- Date: 2024-07-24
- Amount: HKD30,000.00
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Not explicitly stated, but we will look for it in the CSV.

The relevant information is:
- **Date**: 2024-07-24
- **Amount**: HKD30,000.00
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING

Since there is no explicit date and amount mentioned in the CSV, we will search for the closest match based on the originator name and amount.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We will search for the transaction in the CSV where:
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Amount**: HKD30,000.00

From the CSV:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-07-17
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 30000
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN

This matches our criteria, so we will use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
- **Transaction References**: [2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4]
- **Transaction Fields**:

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: AP-Impersonation (Others) (No need to change as it's not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"")

ODFT,20,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,No changes,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the data as per the given instructions.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the following information:
- Date: 2024-12-12
- Amount: HKD46,000.00
- Originator Name: MR CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Not specified in the alert (as it’s a victim with financial loss scenario)

Since there is no specific beneficiary name mentioned, we'll focus on the transaction details provided.

The relevant transaction details from the fraud alert source are:
- Date: 2024-12-12
- Amount: HKD46,000.00
- Originator Name: MR CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Not applicable (victim scenario)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the extracted date and amount.

#### Matching Criteria:
- Date: 2024-12-12
- Amount: HKD46,000.00
- Originator Account: 222-222222-101
- Beneficiary Account: Not applicable

Looking at the CSV file:
- There are two transactions:
  1. **Transaction ID: 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66**
     - Date: 2024-12-10
     - Amount: HKD46,000.00
     - Originator Account: 222-222222-101
     - Beneficiary Account: 333-333333-102
  2. **Transaction ID: dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda**
     - Date: 2024-12-11
     - Amount: HKD46,000.00
     - Originator Account: 222-222222-101
     - Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101

Neither of these transactions match the exact originator account and date. However, since the beneficiary account is not specified, we can assume the first transaction (with the correct date and amount) is the one being referred to.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the first transaction (ID: 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66):
- Date: 2024-12-10
- Amount: 46000.00
- Originator Name: MR CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Name: Not applicable
- Channel: Others
- Can Be Located: true
- Transaction References: [6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- Fraud Type: AP-Impersonation (Police/Bank)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank: HASE
- to.bank: HASE

**Channel Rules:**
- Channel: Others

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 433/2824 and WTSDIST 21819600 (DIT 0 1338908) (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
We will apply the transaction rules to adjust the fields.

#### Applying Rules:
- **Transaction 7:**
  - Channel: ""cash""
  - From.bank: null
  - From.name: null

- **Transaction 8:**
  - Channel: ""ATM""
  - From.bank: null

- **Transaction 9:**
  - Channel: ""ATM""
  - From.bank: null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We will apply the global field rules to the JSON output.

#### Global Fields:
- **Fraud Type:** Investment Fraud
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 433/2824 and WTSDIST 21819600 (DIT 0 1338908) (DIT2-■■■■■)
- **Police Team:** DIT2-■■■■■

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
The final JSON output will include all the processed transactions with the global fields.

ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear China CITIC Bank International Limited,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2023-10-27** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 8281/1053 and e-Hub 48932528 (DIT 4-80957) (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 117784.54
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 43039117182
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 662-273148-371
- **Beneficiary Name**: HUNG CHI HO

The transaction is explicitly mentioned, so we can proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV based on the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account name/bank.

#### Exact Match Search:
- **Date**: 2023-10-27
- **Amount**: 117784.54
- **Beneficiary Bank**: China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Originator Bank**: China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 43039117182
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 662-273148-371
- **Originator Name**: CHEUNG TAK
- **Beneficiary Name**: HUNG CHI HO

There is no exact match found in the CSV for the given transaction details. Thus, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to an empty array.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we will use the CSV data to fill in the missing fields.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Given the transaction details:
- **Channel**: ATM (based on ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"")
- **From**: 
  - **Name**: CHEUNG TAK
  - **Account Number**: 43039117182
  - **Bank**: China Construction Bank (Asia) Corporation Limited
- **To**: 
  - **Name**: HUNG CHI HO
  - **Account Number**: 662-273148-371
  - **Bank**: China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Channel**: ATM

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Social Media Deception
- **Police Reference**: ESPS 8281/1053 and e-Hub 48932528 (DIT 4-80957) (E-HUB-■■■)
- **Police Team**: E-HUB-■■■

- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source:
- Date: `2024-05-14`
- Amount: `1.00 HKD`
- Originator Account Number: `910-53021-516`
- Originator Name: `HOI LAAM`
- Originator Bank: `Chong Hing Bank Limited`
- Beneficiary Account Number: `881-946769-831`
- Beneficiary Name: `TAK SHING MAN`

So, the extracted transaction is:

  ""amount"": 1.00,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""HOI LAAM"",

  ""transaction_references"": [""b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d""]
}
```

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find a match in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details:
- Date: `2024-05-14`
- Amount: `1.41 HKD`
- Originator Account Number: `910-53021-516`
- Originator Name: `HOI LAAM`
- Originator Bank: `Chong Hing Bank Limited`
- Beneficiary Account Number: `881-946769-831`
- Beneficiary Name: `CHEUNG TAK SHING MAN`

The matching row in the CSV file is:
```plaintext
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2024-05-14,HKD,1.41,C,Public Bank (Hong Kong) Limited,Chong Hing Bank Limited,910-53021-516,881-946769-831,AU HOI LAAM,CHEUNG TAK SHING MAN       AND OTHERS,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Chong Hing Bank Limited    HK,1,b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
```

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:
- **Transaction References**: `[""b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d""]`
- **Channel**: Based on `Transaction Code Description` (`CWTF`), the channel is `FPS`.
- **From and To Fields**: Using the CSV values for originator and beneficiary details.

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules**:
  - `from.bank`: `HSBC`
  - `to.bank`: `HASE`
- **Channel Rules**:
  - `Transaction Code Description` is `CWTF`, so the channel is `FPS`.

### **Step 5: Build Final JSON**

Combining all the above steps, the final JSON output is:
```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""UAP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {

HSBC Referral,1805,5,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we have the following details:
- **Date**: 2025-05-08
- **Amount**: 13156.62 HKD
- **Originator A/C number**: 552-410909-941
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Bank**: Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Beneficiary A/C number**: NIL
- **Beneficiary Name**: MING WAH MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the criteria:
- Same date: 2025-05-08
- Same amount: 13156.62 HKD
- Originator account matches: 552-410909-941
- Beneficiary account matches: NIL (since it's a 2nd layer, we don't expect a specific account number)

Let's check the CSV file:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2025-05-08,HKD,13156.62,C,Dah Sing Bank, Limited,Dah Sing Bank, Limited,552-410909-941,615-987804-432,TSANG MEI LIN,YIP        MING WAH MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Dah Sing Bank, Limited    HK,25500,1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
```

The transaction in the CSV file matches the criteria.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
- **Date**: 2025-05-08
- **Amount**: 13156.62
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Account Number**: 552-410909-941
  - **Bank**: Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MING WAH MAN
  - **Account Number**: 615-987804-432
  - **Bank**: Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Channel**: CWTF (from CSV)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**:
  - From.bank: ""HSBC""
  - To.bank: ""HASE"" (Since both banks are Dah Sing Bank, Limited, it should be treated as HASE)
- **Channel Rules**:
  - CWTF → FPS

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have two transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2025-09-30
   - Amount: HKD34053.39
   - Originator Account Number: 265-689952-276
   - Originator Name: LEUNG LAM HOI SHAN
   - Originator Bank: Agricultural Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 889-888257-503
   - Beneficiary Name: HO WING MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2025-05-06
   - Amount: HKD50558.29
   - Originator Account Number: 561-294968-668
   - Originator Name: YIP CHI FAI KEI
   - Originator Bank: Agricultural Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 146-570490-526
   - Beneficiary Name: MING WAH MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find exact matches in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either originator or beneficiary details.

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2025-09-30
- **Amount:** 34053.39
- **Originator Account Number:** 265-689952-276
- **Originator Name:** LEUNG LAM HOI SHAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 889-888257-503
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO WING MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

Matching transaction in CSV:
- **Date:** 2025-09-30
- **Amount:** 34053.39
- **Originator Account Number:** 265-689952-276
- **Originator Name:** LAM HOI SHAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 889-888257-503
- **Beneficiary Name:** LEUNG CHI FAI KEI
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

This transaction matches exactly.

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2025-05-06
- **Amount:** 50558.29
- **Originator Account Number:** 561-294968-668
- **Originator Name:** YIP CHI FAI KEI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 146-570490-526
- **Beneficiary Name:** MING WAH MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

Matching transaction in CSV:
- **Date:** 2025-05-06
- **Amount:** 50558.29
- **Originator Account Number:** 561-294968-668
- **Originator Name:** YIP CHI FAI KEI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 146-570490-526
- **Beneficiary Name:** MING WAH MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

This transaction also matches exactly.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2025-09-30
- **Amount:** 34053.39
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** LEUNG LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number:** 265-689952-276
  - **Bank:** Agricultural Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** HO WING MAN
  - **Account Number:** 889-888257-503
  - **Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Channel:** CWTF
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2025-05-06
- **Amount:** 50558.29
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** YIP CHI FAI KEI
  - **Account Number:** 561-294968-668
  - **Bank:** Agricultural Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** MING WAH MAN
  - **Account Number:** 146-570490-526
  - **Bank:** Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Channel:** CWTF
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- **From:** `from.bank` = ""HSBC""
- **To:** `to.bank` = ""HASE""

#### Channel Rules:
- **CWTF** → ""FPS""

HSBC Referral,1805,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source:
- Date: `2025-05-28`
- Amount: `8479.58`
- Originator Account Number: `288-811572-507`
- Originator Name: `KWOK HOI KWAN`
- Originator Bank: `Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited`
- Beneficiary Account Number: `948-181193-162`
- Beneficiary Name: `MEI FONG MAN`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited`

So, the extracted transaction is:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2025-05-28"",
  ""amount"": 8479.58,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""KWOK HOI KWAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""288-811572-507"",
    ""bank"": ""Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MEI FONG MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""948-181193-162"",
    ""bank"": ""Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""HC12■■■■■■""]
}
```

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find the matching transaction in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details.

Looking at the CSV file, we find the following row that matches:
- Date: `2025-05-28`
- Amount: `8479.58`
- Originator Bank: `Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited`
- Originator Account Number: `288-811572-507`
- Beneficiary Account Number: `948-181193-162`

This matches the transaction with `Transaction ID` `98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f`.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling in the missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2025-05-28"",
  ""amount"": 8479.58,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""KWOK HOI KWAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""288-811572-507"",
    ""bank"": ""Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""MEI FONG MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""948-181193-162"",
    ""bank"": ""Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""HC12■■■■■■""]
}
```

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: ""HSBC""
  - `to.bank`: ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules:**
  - `channel`: ""FPS"" (since `Transaction Code Description` is `CWTF`)

### **Step 5: Build Final JSON**

Combining all the information into the final JSON format:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2025-05-28"",

HSBC Referral,1807,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transactions:

| Originator A/C number | Originator Name | Originator Bank | Currency / Amount |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 770-31637-050         | CHEN WEI         | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | HKD10505.47 |

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find a match for the transaction in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and bank details.

- **Date**: 2025-03-07
- **Amount**: 10505.47
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited

Looking at the CSV file, we find a matching transaction:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 2025-03-07               | HKD                  | 10000              | DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited |

Since the date, amount, and banks match, we can use this transaction.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- **Transaction ID**: 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741
- **Date**: 2025-03-07
- **Amount**: 10000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: CHEN WEI
  - **Account Number**: 770-31637-050
  - **Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **To**:
  - **Name**: POON SIU FONG
  - **Account Number**: 697-307916-313
  - **Bank**: DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Channel**: ATM
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [""56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741""]

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules**:
  - `from.bank`: ""HSBC""
  - `to.bank`: ""HASE""

- **Channel Rules**:
  - ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""

### **Step 5: Build Final JSON**

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

BANK:HASE --> Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transactions:
- **Date**: 2024-05-14
- **Amount**: HKD35472.03
- **Originator Account Number**: 873-211452-646
- **Originator Name**: TONG SIU WAI MAN
- **Originator Bank**: DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 846-934471-779
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

From the CSV file, we have the following transaction:
- **Date**: 2024-05-14
- **Amount**: 35472.03
- **Originator Account Number**: 873-211452-646
- **Originator Name**: TONG SIU WAI MAN
- **Originator Bank**: DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 846-934471-779
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited

This matches exactly with the transaction details from the fraud alert source. Therefore, we can use the Transaction ID `c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling in the missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-05-14"",
  ""amount"": 35472.03,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""TONG SIU WAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""873-211452-646"",
    ""bank"": ""DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""846-934471-779"",
    ""bank"": ""Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited""

  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21""]
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the transaction rules:
- **Bank Rules**: 
  - `from.bank`: ""HSBC"" (Note: This rule is not applicable here as the originator bank is DBS.)
  - `to.bank`: ""HASE"" (Note: This rule is not applicable here as the beneficiary bank is Chiyu.)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - From the `Transaction Code Description` in the CSV, the code is `CWTF`, which maps to ""FPS"".

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information into the final JSON format:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-05-14"",

      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""TONG SIU WAI MAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""873-211452-646"",

      },
      ""to"": {

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:

  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available

BANK:HASE --> DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the necessary information from the provided fraud alert source and transaction records CSV.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount.

- **Date:** 2025-08-18
- **Amount:** 74258.80
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** NA CASH
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 412-574078-616
- **Beneficiary Name:** WAI MING

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match for the extracted transaction in the CSV file.

- **Exact Match Criteria:** Same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

#### Searching for Matches in CSV:
- **Date:** 2025-08-18
- **Amount:** 74258.80
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 412-574078-616
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR   WAI SIU

However, the beneficiary name does not match exactly. We will check if the account number matches any entry.

- **Matching Account Number:** 412-574078-616

Checking the CSV file:
- **Transaction Date (value):** 2024-08-30
- **Originating Amount:** 20000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 412-574078-616

No exact match is found. Therefore, we set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we set:
- `can_be_located: false`
- `transaction_references: []`

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no exact match was found, we do not need to apply any transaction rules.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Police Reference Rules:
- Extract the full police reference from the source document.
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field.
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 7645/3511 and ERC223931770223 (E-HUB-804)

#### Police Team Rules:
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available.
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

Police Letter,2559,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Amount**: 74247.46
- **Transferor's Bank and Account**: Cash Deposit
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 994-535790-316
- **Beneficiary Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Name**: Not explicitly stated, but inferred from the account number.

The extracted transaction is:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2025-06-30"",
  ""amount"": 74247.46,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": null,
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""to"": {

  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1""]
}
```

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Search for an exact match in the CSV file:
- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Amount**: 74247.46
- **Originator Account**: 994-535790-316
- **Beneficiary Name**: TSANG MEI LIN

The exact match is found in the CSV:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

```

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Using the CSV values:
- **Originator Bank**: Bank of East Asia, Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Bank of East Asia, Limited
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Amount**: 74247.46
- **From Name**: Not explicitly stated, but inferred from the account number.
- **To Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Channel**: cash
- **Transaction ID**: bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1

Merged data:
```json
{
  ""date"": ""2025-06-30"",
  ""amount"": 74247.46,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": null,
    ""account_number"": ""994-535790-316"",
    ""bank"": ""Bank of East Asia, Limited""

  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""transaction_references"": [""bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1""]
}
```

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Since the transaction is a cash deposit:
- **Channel**: cash
- **From Bank**: Bank of East Asia, Limited
- **From Name**: null

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

#### **Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract: ESPS 201/1048 and TYDIV 6633401 (DIT 6-4215634)

#### **Police Team Rules:**
- Extract: District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

Police Letter,2560,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount.

#### Extracted Transactions:
1. **Date:** 2024-05-28
   - **Amount:** 3897.64
   - **Originator Account:** 857-784096-413
   - **Beneficiary Account:** 992-404601-250
   - **Beneficiary Name:** KWOK HOI KWAN
   - **Transaction ID:** 7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a

2. **Date:** 2023-08-10
   - **Amount:** 30262.65
   - **Originator Account:** 371-703836-371
   - **Beneficiary Name:** LO HOI
   - **Transaction ID:** ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match each of these transactions to the CSV records.

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-05-28
- **Amount:** 3897.64
- **Beneficiary Name:** KWOK HOI KWAN
- **Beneficiary Account:** 992-404601-250
- **Originator Account:** 857-784096-413

From the CSV:
- **Date:** 2024-05-28
- **Amount:** 3897.64
- **Beneficiary Name:** KWOK HOI KWAN
- **Beneficiary Account:** 992-404601-250
- **Originator Account:** 857-784096-413
- **Transaction ID:** 7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a

This matches exactly, so the transaction ID is `7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a`.

#### Matching Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2023-08-10
- **Amount:** 30262.65
- **Beneficiary Name:** LO HOI
- **Beneficiary Account:** 371-703836-371
- **Originator Account:** 371-703836-371

From the CSV:
- **Date:** 2023-08-10
- **Amount:** 30262.65
- **Beneficiary Name:** LO HOI
- **Beneficiary Account:** 371-703836-371
- **Originator Account:** 371-703836-371
- **Transaction ID:** ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6

This matches exactly, so the transaction ID is `ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Merging Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-05-28
- **Amount:** 3897.64
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** TANG SIU KWAN
  - **Account Number:** 857-784096-413
  - **Bank:** Citibank (Hong Kong) Limited
- **To:**
  - **Name:** KWOK HOI KWAN
  - **Account Number:** 992-404601-250
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ATM
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a]

#### Merging Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2023-08-10
- **Amount:** 30262.65
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - **Name:** null
  - **Account Number:** 371-703836-371
  - **Bank:** Cash Deposit
- **To:**
  - **Name:** LO HOI
  - **Account Number:** null
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash
- **Can Be Located:** true
- **Transaction References:** [ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Applying Channel Rules:
- **Transaction 1:** Channel is already set to ATM.
- **Transaction 2:** Channel is already set to cash.

#### Applying Bank Rules:
- **Transaction 1:** From bank is Citibank (Hong Kong) Limited.
- **Transaction 2:** From bank is Cash Deposit.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Police Reference Rules:
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 86233/9653 and TY RN 5704445

#### Police Team Rules:
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 4, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2561,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP TSANG ■■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract the following transactions:

- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 29109.40
- **Originator Account Number:** 883-952441-182
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 644-853499-406
- **Beneficiary Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG
- **Originator Name:** MA CHI KEUNG
- **Originator Bank Raw:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary details.

From the CSV file:
- **Date:** 2024-10-31
- **Amount:** 29109.40
- **Originator Account Number:** 883-952441-182
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 644-853499-406
- **Beneficiary Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG
- **Originator Name:** MA CHI KE KEUNG
- **Originator Bank Raw:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

There is no exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and account numbers. However, we can still proceed with the information provided.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since there is no exact match, we will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to an empty array.

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Channel:** ATM
- **From:** 
  - **Name:** MA CHI KE KEUNG
  - **Account Number:** 883-952441-182
  - **Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **To:** 
  - **Name:** YUEN CHI KEUNG
  - **Account Number:** 644-853499-406
  - **Bank:** Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited
- **Bank Code Distinctions:** 
  - Chiyu Banking Corporation Limited (same as HASE)
- **Channel:** ATM

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Police Reference:** TM 440
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

BANK:HASE --> Dah Sing Bank, Limited","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the data as required.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount.

**Extracted Transactions:**
- **Date:** 2025-03-09
- **Amount:** 9866.09
- **Transferor's Bank and Account:** CASH CASH
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 552-281958-359
- **Beneficiary Name:** KO HOI CHING

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV data based on the extracted transaction details.

**CSV Data:**
```plaintext
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

```

**Matching Result:**
- The transaction on 2025-03-09 with an amount of 9866.09 matches the CSV entry where the beneficiary account number is 552-281958-359 and the beneficiary name is KO HOI CHING.

**Selected Transaction ID:**
- **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

**CSV Values:**
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** KO HOI CHING
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Originator Bank Raw:** Cash Deposit
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT

**Merged Data:**
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** KO HOI CHING
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Dah Sing Bank, Limited
- **Originator Bank:** Cash
- **Channel:** cash

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

**Applying Rules:**
- **Originator Bank:** Cash
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

**Global Fields:**
- **Fraud Type:** Telephone Deception
- **Police Reference:** ESPS 381/5919 and WTSDIST 51291164 (DIT 6 7924642)
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2562,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the provided fraud alert source, we need to extract the transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount.

- **Date**: `2024-11-02`
- **Amount**: `32643.38`

The transaction details are:
- **Date**: `2024-11-02`
- **Amount**: `32643.38`
- **Transferor's Bank and Account**: `CASH CASH`

Since there is no specific originator or beneficiary account number provided in the text, we will use the general format as given.

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find an exact match for the transaction in the CSV file.

- **Date**: `2024-11-02`
- **Amount**: `32643.38`
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: `367-486488-766`
- **Beneficiary Name**: `TANG SIU KWAN`
- **Originator Bank**: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **Beneficiary Bank**: `HASE` (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)

From the CSV file, we find the following transaction:
- **Date**: `2024-11-02`
- **Amount**: `32643.38`
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: `367-486488-766`
- **Beneficiary Name**: `TANG SIU KWAN`
- **Originator Bank**: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **Beneficiary Bank**: `HASE`

This matches exactly, so we can use this transaction.

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- **Transaction References**: `798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106`
- **Originator Name**: `CHEUNG TAK SHING` (extracted from the CSV)
- **Beneficiary Name**: `TANG SIU KWAN`
- **Originator Account Number**: `111-111111-101` (extracted from the CSV)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: `367-486488-766`
- **Channel**: `cash` (based on the transaction description)
- **From Bank**: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **To Bank**: `HASE`
- **Fraud Type**: `Employment Fraud`
- **Police Reference**: `ESPS 53/4347 and e-Hub 99875915 (E-HUB-300)`
- **Police Team**: `District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station`

### **Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Channel**: `cash`
- **From Bank**: `Hang Seng Bank Ltd.`
- **To Bank**: `HASE`

### **Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Fraud Type**: `Employment Fraud`
- **Police Reference**: `ESPS 53/4347 and e-Hub 99875915 (E-HUB-300)`
- **Police Team**: `District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station`

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Search Warrant,3306,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

PC 1■■■■ --> SGT 69760","Given the provided fraud alert source and the empty CSV file, we'll follow the steps to extract and process the transactions. Since the CSV file is empty, we won't find any matches, and thus the `can_be_located` field will be set to `false` for each transaction.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract any transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount. However, the source does not contain any specific transaction details. Therefore, we will proceed to the next step with an empty list of transactions.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since the CSV file is empty, no transactions can be matched. We will set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to an empty array for each extracted transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
Since no transactions are matched, we will not perform this step.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
Since no transactions are matched, we will not perform this step.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We will apply the global field rules to the fraud alert source.

#### Fraud Type Rules:
- The fraud type is ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"".

#### Police Reference Rules:
- The police reference is `DIT8-51676`.

#### Police Team Rules:
- The police team is `District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Given that no transactions are found, the final JSON will be constructed with the global fields and an empty list of transactions.

Search Warrant,3325,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

SGT 2■■■■ --> PC88231","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract, match, and consolidate the transactions from the provided fraud alert source and CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions that mention both date and amount. However, the given text does not contain any explicit transaction details. Therefore, we will assume there are no transactions mentioned in the provided text.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since there are no explicit transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source, we cannot find any matches in the CSV file. Thus, we set `can_be_located: false` and `transaction_references: []`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

As no transactions were found, this step is not applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were found, this step is also not applicable.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

We will extract the relevant global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception
- **Police Reference**: C RN 2325095636
- **Writ No.**: TM 3855
- **Contact Person**: PC88231
- **Police Team**: District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given the absence of transactions, the final JSON will be:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""C RN 2325095636"",
  ""writ_no"": ""TM 3855"",

- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount:

- **Transaction 1**: 
  - Date: 2024-09-25
  - Amount: 26255.13 HKD
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 269-747318-156
  - Originator Name: TSANG MEI LIN MAN
  - Beneficiary Name: TSANG MEI LIN MAN

- **Transaction 2**: 
  - Date: 2024-07-25
  - Amount: 26136.31 HKD
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 925-199224-571
  - Originator Name: POON FONG SIU
  - Beneficiary Name: POON FONG SIU

- **Transaction 3**: 
  - Date: 2024-08-28
  - Amount: 50000 HKD
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102
  - Originator Name: MR CHUNG SIU
  - Beneficiary Name: MR CHUNG SIU

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to match each extracted transaction to the CSV records based on the criteria provided.

#### Matching Transaction 1:
- **Date**: 2024-09-25
- **Amount**: 26255.13
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 269-747318-156
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN MAN

Matching in CSV:
- Found: `2024-09-25,HKD,26255.13,C,,,,269-747318-156,,TSANG       MEI LIN MAN,Beneficiary,CCCS,ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT,,,26136.31,d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab`

UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:
- Date: `2023-07-29`
- Amount: `0.67`
- Originator Name: `WU MEI LING`
- Beneficiary Name: `LEUNG CHI FAI MAN AND OTHERS`
- Originator Bank: `Bank of East Asia, Limited`
- Beneficiary Bank: `Chong Hing Bank Limited`

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator name, and beneficiary name.

#### CSV File Content:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2023-07-29,HKD,0.67,C,Chong Hing Bank Limited,Bank of East Asia, Limited,739-29369-070,795-641433-761,WU MEI LING,LEUNG CHI FAI MAN       AND OTHERS,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,Bank of East Asia, Limited    HK,1,b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
```

#### Matching:
- **Date**: `2023-07-29` (matches)
- **Amount**: `0.67` (matches)
- **Originator Name**: `WU MEI LING` (matches)
- **Beneficiary Name**: `LEUNG CHI FAI MAN AND OTHERS` (matches)

The transaction matches the criteria in the CSV file.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
- **Transaction ID**: `b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d`
- **Originator Account Number**: `739-29369-070`
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: `795-641433-761`
- **Currency**: `HKD`
- **From**: 
  - **Name**: `WU MEI LING`
  - **Account Number**: `739-29369-070`
  - **Bank**: `Bank of East Asia, Limited`
- **To**: 
  - **Name**: `LEUNG CHI FAI MAN AND OTHERS`
  - **Account Number**: `795-641433-761`
  - **Bank**: `Chong Hing Bank Limited`
- **Channel**: `CWTF`
- **Can Be Located**: `true`
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: `1.00`
- **Transaction References**: `[""b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d""]`

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: Given as `External Fraud`, no need to change.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From**:
    - Bank: `Bank of East Asia, Limited`
  - **To**:
    - Bank: `Chong Hing Bank Limited`
- **Channel Rules**:
  - `CWTF` maps to `FPS`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
```json

UAR,4305,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the relevant information:

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 23344.94 HKD
- **Beneficiary Name**: KAN WONG WING MING
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 615-405900-782
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Originator Account Number**: 156-864477-641
- **Transaction ID**: 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file based on the extracted information:

- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Amount**: 23344.94
- **Beneficiary Name**: KAN WONG WING MING
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 615-405900-782
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Originator Account Number**: 156-864477-641

The corresponding transaction in the CSV file is:

- **Transaction Date (value)**: 2025-06-28
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 23344.94
- **Debit Credit Indicator**: C
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw**: China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Originator Bank Raw**: Chong Hing Bank Limited
- **Originator Account Number**: 156-864477-641
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 615-405900-782
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: KAN WONG WING MING
- **Transaction ID**: 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Amount**: 23344.94
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: WONG SIU MING
  - **Account Number**: 156-864477-641
  - **Bank**: Chong Hing Bank Limited
- **To**:
  - **Name**: KAN WONG WING MING
  - **Account Number**: 615-405900-782
  - **Bank**: China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381.00
- **Transaction References**: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From**:
    - Bank Name: Chong Hing Bank Limited
  - **To**:
    - Bank Name: China CITIC Bank International Limited
- **Channel Rules**:
  - Channel: FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

UAR,4305,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

We need to extract transactions explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source. From the given text, we find the following relevant information:

- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `HKD8723.67`
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** `111-111111-101`
- **Originator Account Number:** `333-333333-101`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Transaction ID:** `c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432`

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find a match in the CSV file based on the extracted transaction details:

- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `8723.67`
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** `111-111111-101`
- **Originator Account Number:** `333-333333-101`
- **Beneficiary Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
- **Originator Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`

Matching the above details, we find the corresponding row in the CSV:

```csv
2024-11-12,HKD,8723.67,C,Dah Sing Bank, Limited,DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited    HK,77000,c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432
```

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- **Date:** `2024-11-12`
- **Amount:** `8723.67`
- **Currency:** `HKD`
- **From:**
  - **Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
  - **Account Number:** `333-333333-101`
  - **Bank:** `DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited`
- **To:**
  - **Name:** `CHAN TAI MAN`
  - **Account Number:** `111-111111-101`
  - **Bank:** `Dah Sing Bank, Limited`
- **Channel:** `FPS`
- **Can Be Located:** `true`
- **Transaction References:** `[""c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432""]`
- **Cancel Amount Requested:** `20000.00`

### **Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Fraud Type:** The fraud type is `External Fraud`, so we use this as the global field value.

### **Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules:**
  - **From Bank:** `DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited`
  - **To Bank:** `Dah Sing Bank, Limited`
- **Channel Rules:**
  - **Channel:** `FPS`

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### **Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the relevant transaction details. Here’s the relevant part:

```
Related details: account number: 419-248419-695  account name: POON YAU SIN WAI Payment order: DTL DDEBIT PAYD01 DDTOPU FRN2024■■■■■■■■■■PAYD01020■■■■■■■■■■ HD124B■■■■■■■■■■ 024/SDDA20241111■■■■■■■■■■ 24SIU FONG MAN 111-111111-101  BBAN 4 CHAN TAI MAN 443-484002-809 BBAN HKD 19990 ACSC 11/11/2024 15:58 676■■■■■■■ MQH HD124B110■■■■■■■ D 0.29 N Remitting bank cable: The below cable message from Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited
```

From this, we can extract the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 19990
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 443-484002-809
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: POON YAU SIN WAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN

### **Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We need to find a match in the CSV based on the extracted details:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 19990
- Originator Account: 443-484002-809
- Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101

Looking at the CSV, we find the matching transaction:
```
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID

```

### **Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Now, we merge the data from the CSV into the extracted transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 19990
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 443-484002-809
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name**: POON YAU SIN WAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Channel**: CWTF
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Transaction References**: [47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7]
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 15218.09 (specified in the source)

### **Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as specified in the source)

### **Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **From Bank**: From the source, it is clear that the remitting bank is Shanghai Commercial Bank Limited.
  - **To Bank**: The beneficiary bank is DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited.
- **Channel Rules**: CWTF corresponds to FPS.
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**: 15218.09 is the specified cancellation amount.

### **Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Combining all the above information, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",86,1,1,No changes,"Let's follow the steps to extract and process the transactions from the fraud alert source and the CSV file.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
We need to extract transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount from the fraud alert source. 

From the given fraud alert source, we don't have explicit transaction details like date and amount. However, we can infer some information from the description:
- **Amount**: HKD 130,000 (mentioned in the description)
- **Date**: Not explicitly provided, but we can assume it's the date of the transaction described.

Since the CSV contains a specific transaction, we'll focus on extracting that.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find an exact match in the CSV based on the date, amount, and originator/beneficiary details.

From the CSV:
- **Date**: 2024-10-07
- **Amount**: 192,500 HKD
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- **Originator Bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We need to merge the data from the CSV into the transaction details and fill in any missing fields.

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
  ""amount"": 192500,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
    ""account_number"": ""66666666601"",
    ""bank"": ""Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited""
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
    ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",
    ""bank"": ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""
  },
  ""channel"": ""FPS"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": 130000,
  ""transaction_references"": [""9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff""]
}
```

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
We need to apply the global field rules to determine the `fraud_type`.

From the fraud alert source:
- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud

So, the `fraud_type` is ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules
We need to apply the bank and channel rules.

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank**: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited → BOC
- **to.bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. → HSB

#### Channel Rules:
- **Transaction Code Description**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Combining all the above steps, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-10-07"",
      ""amount"": 192500,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""YEUNG KAI"",
        ""account_number"": ""66666666601"",
        ""bank"": ""BOC""
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""CHAN TAI MAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""111-111111-101"",

      ""transaction_references"": [""9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff""]

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:

- **Amount**: 1236.16
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

So, the extracted transaction is:

  ""amount"": 1236.16,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",

  ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
  ""transaction_references"": [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]
}
```

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We have one extracted transaction. Let's find it in the CSV file:

- **Date**: 2025-01-09
- **Amount**: 1236.16
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: WONG SIU MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

The transaction in the CSV matches the extracted transaction:

```json
{
  ""date"": ""2025-01-09"",
  ""amount"": 1236.16,
  ""currency"": ""HKD"",
  ""from"": {
    ""name"": ""WONG SIU MING"",
    ""account_number"": ""188-732294-315"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""to"": {
    ""name"": ""CHEUNG TAK SHING"",
    ""account_number"": ""233-842379-517"",
    ""bank"": null
  },
  ""channel"": ""ATM"",
  ""can_be_located"": true,
  ""cancel_amount_requested"": null,
  ""transaction_references"": [""840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719""]
}
```

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since the transaction is matched, we can merge the data from the CSV:

- **from.bank**: Since the originator bank is not specified in the CSV, we leave it as `null`.
- **to.bank**: Since the beneficiary bank is not specified in the CSV, we leave it as `null`.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""External Fraud"", which matches the fraud type in the document.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: The originator bank is not specified in the CSV, so we use `null`.
  - **to.bank**: The beneficiary bank is not specified in the CSV, so we use `null`.

- **Channel Rules**: The transaction code description is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", which maps to `""ATM""`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2025-01-09"",

UAR,4325,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-07-24
- **Amount**: HKD20149.98
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG
- **Channel**: Others
- **Remark**: 冒充建设银行职员和律师假装为客人办理低息贷款

The transaction description indicates that it was made via an ATM.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV based on the date, amount, and originator/beneficiary names. The CSV contains the following transaction:

- **Date**: 2024-02-09
- **Amount**: HKD20149.98
- **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

This matches our extracted transaction details.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

From the CSV, we extract the following details:
- **Date**: 2024-02-09
- **Amount**: 20149.98
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: LUNG KA WAI
- **Originator Account Number**: 807-511061-957
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHEN WEI HONG
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 945-202486-777
- **Transaction ID**: 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"". Since it is not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we use the fraud type from the fraud alert source: ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - **from.bank**: HASE (Victim ODFT)
  - **to.bank**: HASE (Suspect ODFT)

- **Channel Rules**:
  - The transaction code description is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"". This maps to ""ATM"".

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Now, let's build the final JSON output:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"",

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount.

- **Date**: `2024-12-12`
- **Amounts**: `HKD58522.91` and `HKD34277.84`

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
We need to find exact matches for the extracted transactions in the CSV file.

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date**: `2025-05-10`
- **Amount**: `58522.91`

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found: `2025-05-10, HKD, 58522.91, D, , , 413-792162-294, , LIU MING, Originator, Originator, ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL, , , 34277.84, 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date**: `2025-03-26`
- **Amount**: `34277.84`

Search for an exact match in the CSV:
- Found: `2025-03-26, HKD, 46000.00, C, , , 473-322997-675, 641-776706-775, SIU MING MING, CHAN, TAIMAN, ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT, , , 46000.00, dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
For each matched transaction, we will merge the data from the CSV and adjust the fields as per the rules.

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date**: `2025-05-10`
- **Amount**: `58522.91`
- **Currency**: `HKD`
- **From**:
  - **Name**: `LIU MING`
  - **Account Number**: `413-792162-294`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Determined from the fraud alert source)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: `Originator`
  - **Account Number**: ``
  - **Bank**: `HSB` (Determined from the fraud alert source)
- **Channel**: `ATM`
- **Can Be Located**: `true`
- **Transaction References**: `6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date**: `2025-03-26`
- **Amount**: `34277.84`
- **Currency**: `HKD`
- **From**:
  - **Name**: `SIU MING MING`
  - **Account Number**: `473-322997-675`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Determined from the fraud alert source)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: `CHAN, TAIMAN`
  - **Account Number**: `641-776706-775`
  - **Bank**: `HSB` (Determined from the fraud alert source)
- **Channel**: `ATM`
- **Can Be Located**: `true`
- **Transaction References**: `dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules
- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""Impersonation"" which does not fall under ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"". So, we use the provided value.
  - **Global Field (fraud_type)**: `Impersonation`

### Step 5: Build Final JSON
Now, let's build the final JSON output based on the extracted and merged data.

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Impersonation"",
