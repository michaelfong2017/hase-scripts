ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-10-07 | 192500 | HKD | BOC | 66666666601 | YEUNG KAI |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Exact match found for the transaction:

- Date: 2024-10-07
- Amount: 192500
- Originator Bank: BOC
- Beneficiary Bank: HSB
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Applying cash transaction rules: No ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"" in the originator bank or depositor account name, so no changes.

Applying bank rules:
- from.bank: BOC
- to.bank: HSB

Applying channel rules:
- Transaction Code Description is ""Default transaction"", so channel is null.

HSBC Referral,3,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

```python
for transaction in matched_transactions:

        transaction['to']['bank'] = 'Hang Seng Bank Ltd.'
    else:
        transaction['from']['bank'] = transaction['originator_bank']
        transaction['to']['bank'] = transaction['beneficiary_bank_raw']
```

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

```python
for transaction in matched_transactions:
    if transaction['can_be_located']:
        transaction['from']['bank'] = 'HSBC'
    else:
        transaction['from']['bank'] = 'HSBC'

            transaction['channel'] = 'ATM'
        elif transaction['transaction_code_description'] == 'CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)':
            transaction['channel'] = 'cash'
        elif transaction['transaction_code_description'] == 'ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT':
            if transaction['sending_bank_address'] == 'The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK':

        elif transaction['transaction_type_source'] == 'FPWICT':
            transaction['channel'] = 'FPS'
```

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

```python
import json

fraud_type = 'AP-Impersonation (Other)'
final_json = {
    'fraud_type': fraud_type,
    'alerted_transactions': matched_transactions
}

print(json.dumps(final_json, indent=4))
```

The final JSON output will be:

HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,7,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,10,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

Police Letter,11,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Police Letter,12,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case Inspector CHAN ■■■ ■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Extracted transactions:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2024-07-17 | 9000   | CASH CASH                    |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Exact match found for the transaction on 2024-07-17 with the CSV record:

| Transaction ID | Date       | Amount | Originator Bank Raw | Beneficiary Account Number |
|----------------|------------|--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f | 2024-07-17 | 9000   | CASH                | 111-111111-101            |

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Merged data for the matched transaction:

| date       | amount | currency | from | to       | channel |
|------------|--------|----------|------|----------|---------|
| 2024-07-17 | 9000   | HKD      | null | {        | cash    |

|            |        |          |      |  bank:    null |         |

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Applying transaction rules:

* Since the originator bank contains ""cash"", set channel to ""cash"".
* Set from.bank to null.
* Set from.name to null.

Updated merged data:

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

Applying global field rules:

* Extract the full police reference from the source document: POLICEREF1
* Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field. No exclusion needed.
* Extract police team information including district and police station: District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSI FOK ■■■ ■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Search Warrant,6,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, the following transactions are explicitly mentioned with both date and amount:

* None, as there are no transaction amounts mentioned in the source.

However, we can extract the following information:

* Date: 2024-11-01
* Amount: Not mentioned
* From Bank: Hang Seng Bank Limited
* To Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd, AML - Financial Crime Compliance
* From Account: 111-111111-101, 333-333333-101
* To Account: Not mentioned
* Channel: Not mentioned

Since no transaction amounts are mentioned, we will not proceed to Step 2.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we will not proceed to Step 3.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since no transactions were matched in Step 2, we will not proceed to Step 4.

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Since no transactions were matched in Step 2, we will not proceed to Step 5.

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

Search Warrant,25,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

- Date: 2024-11-08
- Amount: 25900
- Originator Bank: Hang Seng Bank Limited
- Beneficiary Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- Originator Account: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
- Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR        CHAN TAI MAN

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

We search for an exact match in the CSV records. The CSV record with the matching transaction ID is:

- Transaction Date: 2024-11-08
- Originating Currency: HKD
- Originating Amount: 25900
- Beneficiary Bank Raw: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- Originator Bank Raw: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

- Beneficiary Name: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
- Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

We found an exact match, so we use this CSV record.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

We extract the transaction references from the CSV record:

- Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

We use the CSV values for all transaction fields and fill in the missing fields with the fraud alert source values.

- Date: 2024-11-08
- Amount: 25900
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: Hang Seng Bank Limited
- To:
  - Name: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101

- Channel: FPS
- Can Be Located: true
- Transaction References: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

We apply the bank rules:

- From Bank: Hang Seng Bank Limited
- To Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited

We apply the channel rules:

- The channel field is FPS.

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

We apply the fraud type rules:

- Fraud Type: Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210

We apply the police reference rules:

- Police Reference: TSWRN240■■■■

We apply the police team rules:

- Police Team: District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District

- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,3,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""

    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

UAR,5,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

Extracting transactions with both date and amount from the fraud alert source:

| Date | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| 2024-11-12 | 77000 |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Matching the extracted transaction to the CSV records:

* Date: 2024-11-12
* Amount: 77000

The exact match is found in the CSV records:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Amount |
| --- | --- |
| 2024-11-12 | 77000 |

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Merging data for the matched transaction:

Applying global field rules:

* Fraud Type: External Fraud

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

Applying transaction rules:

* From Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
* To Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
* Channel: FPS

UAR,5,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"Based on the provided fraud alert source and CSV file, I will follow the step-by-step process to extract transactions, match them to CSV records, and produce a consolidated JSON output.

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, I extracted the following transaction:

* Date: Not specified
* Amount: HKD 300000
* Purpose: To pay for a family member to invest in an online acquaintance's business
* Description: The suspect requested a deposit of HKD 130000 into a third-party account to invest in a business, claiming that the money would be returned after HKD 300000 was deposited.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

I searched for an exact match in the CSV file. The CSV file contains only one transaction, which is:

* Date: 2024-10-07
* Amount: 192500
* Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
* Originator Bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
* Originator Account Number: 66666666601
* Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
* Originator Name: YEUNG KAI
* Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

Since there is no exact match, I will set can_be_located to false and transaction_references to an empty array.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since there is no match, I will not merge any data.

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

* Fraud Type: External Fraud

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

* from.bank: HASE
* to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
* channel: null (no information available)

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Here is the final JSON output:

UAR,13,13,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount from the fraud alert source.

1. Date: 08NOV24
2. Amount: HKD25,900.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Search for an exact match in the CSV file.

- Date: 2024-11-08
- Amount: 25900

Exact match found in the CSV file. Use the Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to""):

- from.name: CHAN TAI MAN
- from.account_number: 333-333333-101
- from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to.name: MR        CHAN TAI MAN
- to.account_number: 111-111111-101
- to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values:

- date: 2024-11-08
- amount: 25900
- currency: HKD
- channel: FPS
- can_be_located: true
- cancel_amount_requested: 17333
- transaction_references: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

Apply the fraud_type rule: Since the fraud_type is ""External Fraud"", use that value.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Apply the bank rules:

- from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to.bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

Apply the channel rules:

- The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null
- Since the transaction code description is not provided, use the transaction source to determine the channel.
- Transaction Source: CWTF → ""FPS""

Apply the special handling for cancel_amount_requested:

- cancel_amount_requested: 17333

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

ODFT,20,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ADCC,307,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **C RN 3547 (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-01-20** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **STRN4150 (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field

- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount from the fraud alert source. Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields. Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content.

| Date | Amount | Originator Name | Originator Bank | Transaction Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 111555 | YEUNG KAI CHUNG | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | HC12■■■■■■ |

|  | 10259 | YEUNG KAI CHUNG | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | HC12■■■■■■ |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

For each transaction extracted in Step 1, search for an exact match in the CSV file. If an exact match is found, use that single Transaction ID. If no match is found, set can_be_located to false and transaction_references to an empty list.

| Date | Amount | Originator Name | Originator Bank | Transaction Reference | Matched Transaction ID | can_be_located | transaction_references |

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

For each matched transaction, extract transaction_references from CSV, then use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to""). Finally, fill missing fields with fraud alert source values. Use null if neither source has the value.

HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content

- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Police Letter,2559,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""police_reference"": ""string | null"",

Police Letter,2560,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2561,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Extracted transactions:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2025-05-13 | 38186  | Heng Sang Bank 903-280481-143 |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Exact match found for the transaction:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account | Transaction ID |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|----------------|
| 2025-05-13 | 38186  | Heng Sang Bank 903-280481-143 | 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9 |

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Merged transaction data:

| date       | amount | from | to     | channel | can_be_located | transaction_references |
|------------|--------|------|--------|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 2025-05-13 | 38186  |      |        |         | true            | [82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9] |

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Applying transaction rules:

- The originator bank name contains ""Heng Sang Bank"", which is not a standard bank name. However, it is close to ""Hang Seng Bank"", which is a standard bank name. Therefore, we will use ""Hang Seng Bank"" as the bank name.
- The channel field can be determined based on the transaction code description. In this case, it is ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT"", which corresponds to ""ATM"".
- The from.bank field is set to ""Hang Seng Bank"".
- The to.bank field is set to ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."".
- The from.name field is set to ""WU CHI WAI"".
- The to.name field is set to ""LIU MING FUNG"".

Updated transaction data:

| date       | amount | from       | to         | channel | can_be_located | transaction_references |
|------------|--------|------------|------------|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 2025-05-13 | 38186  | {name: ""WU CHI WAI"", account_number: ""903-280481-143"", bank: ""Hang Seng Bank""} | {name: ""LIU MING FUNG"", account_number: ""361-740216-723"", bank: ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd.""} | ATM | true | [82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9] |

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

Applying global field rules:

- The police reference is not explicitly mentioned in the source document, so it is set to null.
- The police team is ""District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station"".

Updated global fields:

| fraud_type | police_reference | police_team |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Telephone Deception | null | District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station |

- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Search Warrant,3306,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, I extracted the following transactions:

- Date: 2024-11-01
- Amount: Not explicitly mentioned
- However, two bank account numbers are mentioned: 111-111111-101 and 333-333333-101

Since the amount is not explicitly mentioned, I will not proceed with the extraction of this transaction.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Since no transaction date and amount are provided, I will not proceed with matching the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since no transactions were matched, there is no data to merge.

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Since no transactions were matched, there is no data to apply transaction rules to.

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

No transactions are explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount. However, the source mentions a specific bank account number: 111-111111-102. We will proceed with this information for further processing.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
No exact match is found for the mentioned account number in the CSV file. Therefore, we will set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: [] for the extracted transaction.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
Since no match was found, we will not merge any data from the CSV file.

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
No bank name is mentioned in the source file, so we will use the bank name from the CSV data as-is. The bank name is Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
The fraud_type is ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". No other fraud type hints are found in the document, so we will use this value.

The police_reference is STRN6523.

The writ_no is 19140.

The contact_person is PC 23276.

The police_team is District Investigation Team 7, Sha Tin District, Hong Kong POLICE.

Search Warrant,3325,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4302,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, I extracted the following transactions:

1. 8月29日 12:08 存入HKD12831 至 992-535728-826
2. 8月30日 16:32 存入HKD12831 至 985-735588-214

These transactions have both date and amount, so they are included in the extraction.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For each transaction extracted in Step 1, I searched for an exact match in the CSV records. Here are the results:

1. 8月29日 12:08 存入HKD12831 至 992-535728-826
   - Exact match found in CSV: 2024-08-29,HKD,12831,C,,,,992-535728-826,,MR       YIP HOI MAN,Beneficiary,CCCS,ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT,,,12831,d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
   - Selected Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab

2. 8月30日 16:32 存入HKD12831 至 985-735588-214
   - Exact match found in CSV: 2024-08-30,HKD,12831,C,,,,985-735588-214,,MR   LAM HOI SHAN,Beneficiary,CCCS,ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT,,,12831,4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
   - Selected Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

For each matched transaction, I extracted the transaction references (Transaction IDs) from the CSV and used the CSV values for all transaction fields. I then filled in the missing fields with the fraud alert source values.

1. 
   - Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab
   - Date: 2024-08-29
   - Amount: 12831
   - Currency: HKD
   - From:
     - Name: MR       YIP HOI MAN
     - Account Number: 992-535728-826
     - Bank: HASE
   - To:
     - Name: MR       YIP HOI MAN
     - Account Number: 
     - Bank: HASE
   - Channel: ATM
   - Can be located: false
   - Cancel amount requested: null
   - Transaction references: [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]

2. 
   - Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014
   - Date: 2024-08-30
   - Amount: 12831
   - Currency: HKD
   - From:
     - Name: MR   LAM HOI SHAN
     - Account Number: 985-735588-214
     - Bank: HASE
   - To:
     - Name: MR   LAM HOI SHAN
     - Account Number: 
     - Bank: HASE
   - Channel: ATM
   - Can be located: false
   - Cancel amount requested: null
   - Transaction references: [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

For the global field ""fraud_type"", I applied the rules:

- Since the fraud_type is ""External Fraud"", I will look for other fraud type hints in the document. However, there are no other hints, so I will use the fraud_type value from the fraud alert source, which is ""External Fraud"".

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

For the bank field, I applied the rules:

- For the first transaction, the bank is HASE.
- For the second transaction, the bank is also HASE.

For the channel field, I applied the rules:

- Both transactions have a transaction code description of ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"", so I will set the channel to ""ATM"".

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Here is the final JSON output:

UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""

  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4305,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4305,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",86,1,1,,,No replacements made,"Based on the provided documents, I will follow the step-by-step process to extract transactions, match them to the CSV records, and produce a consolidated JSON output.

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, I extracted the following transaction:

* Date: Not specified
* Amount: HKD 300000
* Purpose: To pay for a family member to invest in an online acquaintance's business
* Description: The customer was asked to deposit HKD 130000 into a third-party account, claiming it was to return the principal to his son, but the bank staff suspected a scam and refused to process the transaction.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

I searched for an exact match in the CSV records. The CSV record with the matching date and amount is:

* Transaction Date: 2024-10-07
* Originating Amount: 192500
* Currency: HKD

However, the amount in the fraud alert source is HKD 300000, which does not match the CSV record. Therefore, I will set can_be_located to false and transaction_references to an empty array.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since no exact match was found, I will not merge any data from the CSV record.

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

* Fraud Type: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

* from.bank: HASE (from the fraud alert source)
* to.bank: HASE
* channel: null (no information available)
* cancel_amount_requested: null (no information available)

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

UAR,4325,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the fraud alert source, we can extract the following transaction:

| Date | Amount | Currency | Channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-07-17 | 16256 | HKD | Others |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will match the extracted transaction to the CSV records.

- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
  - Exact match found: 2024-07-17, 16256, HKD
  - Matched transaction: 2024-07-17,HKD,16256,C,,,862-513276-255,626-906866-114,MA CHI KEUNG,LI WEI HONG,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT,,,16256,2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs)
  - 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")

  - from.account_number: 862-513276-255
  - from.bank: null
  - to.name: LI WEI HONG
  - to.account_number: 626-906866-114
  - to.bank: null
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
  - date: 2024-07-17
  - amount: 16256
  - currency: HKD
  - channel: Others

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type Rules:
  - fraud_type: Impersonation

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- Bank Rules:
  - from.bank: HASE
  - to.bank: HASE
- Channel Rules (Payment Method):

ODFT,5070,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, the following transaction is extracted:

| date | amount | currency |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-12-12 | 92000.00 | HKD |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For the extracted transaction, search for an exact match in the CSV records. The exact match is found in the second row of the CSV:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |
| 2024-12-11 | HKD | 47111 | C |  |  | 174-404196-868 | 439-575754-730 | TSE HOK MING | AU YEUNG TAI MING | Beneficiary | CUTF | ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT |  |  |  | dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda |

However, the amount in the CSV record (47111) does not match the amount in the fraud alert source (92000.00). Since no exact match is found, search for transactions with previous dates using the same amount and account/name match criteria.

After searching, a match is found in the first row of the CSV:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |
| 2024-12-10 | HKD | 47111 | D |  |  | 174-404196-868 | 102-659333-750 | HUI TAI MAN | AU YEUNG TAI MING | Originator | DUTF | ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   WITHDRAWAL |  |  |  | 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66 |

This match has a previous date (2024-12-10) and the same amount (47111) and account numbers. Therefore, this transaction is selected as the match.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

The matched transaction from the CSV is:

| Transaction Date (value) | Originating Currency | Originating Amount | Debit Credit Indicator | Beneficiary Bank Raw | Originator Bank Raw | Originator Account Number | Beneficiary Account Number | Originator Name | Beneficiary Name | Subject Type | Transaction Type Source | Transaction Code Description | Sending Bank Account Number | Sending Bank Address | Converted Amount | Transaction ID |
| 2024-12-10 | HKD | 47111 | D |  |  | 174-404196-868 | 102-659333-750 | HUI TAI MAN | AU YEUNG TAI MING | Originator | DUTF | ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   WITHDRAWAL |  |  |  | 6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66 |

Merging the data with the fraud alert source:

| date | amount | currency | from | to | channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2024-12-10 | 47111 | HKD | { ""name"": ""HUI TAI MAN"", ""account_number"": ""174-404196-868"", ""bank"": null } | { ""name"": ""AU YEUNG TAI MING"", ""account_number"": ""102-659333-750"", ""bank"": null } | Others |

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

The fraud type is ""Impersonation"".

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

The from.bank is ""HASE"" and the to.bank is ""HASE"".

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

The final JSON output is:
