ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transactions with both date and amount:

1. **2024-08-24, 50000, HKD, HSBC, Hong Kong, 444-4444444-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
2. **2024-08-25, 10000, HKD, HSBC, Hong Kong, 444-4444444-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
3. **2024-08-24, 31000, HKD, HSB, Hong Kong, 222-222222-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
4. **2024-08-25, 50000, HKD, HSB, Hong Kong, 222-222222-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
5. **2024-08-25, 60000, HKD, HSB, Hong Kong, 222-222222-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
6. **2024-08-25, 30000, HKD, HSB, Hong Kong, 222-222222-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
7. **2024-08-25, 39000, HKD, , Hong Kong, , CHEUNG TAK SHING**
8. **2024-08-25, 50000, HKD, HSBC, Hong Kong, 444-4444444-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**
9. **2024-08-25, 50000, HKD, HSB, Hong Kong, 222-222222-101, CHEUNG TAK SHING**

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source and matches them with the CSV records, applying all necessary rules and transformations.",3909.0,5706.0,False,False,True
ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:

| Date       | Currency | Involved Amounts | Approx. HKD | Remitting Bank | AC Location | Depositor AC No. | Depositor AC Name |
|------------|----------|------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| 2024-10-07 | HKD      | 192500           | 192500      | BOC            | Hong Kong   | 66666666601      | YEUNG KAI         |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and either the originator or beneficiary account details.

CSV Record:
- Date: 2024-10-07
- Originating Amount: 192500
- Originator Account Number: 66666666601
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Originator Name: YEUNG KAI
- Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Transaction ID: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff

This matches the transaction details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data:

- Transaction ID: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
- Date: 2024-10-07
- Amount: 192500
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: YEUNG KAI
  - Account Number: 66666666601
  - Bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- To:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- Channel: CWTF (Branch)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- The originator bank does not contain ""cash,"" so no special rules apply.
- The beneficiary bank is Hang Seng Bank Ltd., which should be set to ""HASE.""
- The channel is ""Branch"" based on the CSV Transaction Source ""CWTF.""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: Social Media Deception
- Police Reference: ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)
- Police Team: E-HUB-■■■

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,3,3,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

The CSV record matches the extracted transaction details.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data and apply the necessary rules.

#### Merged Data:
- **Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From (Originator):**
  - **Name:** YEUNG KAI (from source)
  - **Account Number:** 666-66666-601

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 25500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: NIL
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and originator/beneficiary details.

#### CSV Matching Criteria:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 25500
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN (trimmed to CHAN TAI MAN)

Matching row in CSV:
```csv
2024-11-12,HKD,25500,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK,25500,1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
```

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV row, we merge the data:
- **Transaction ID**: 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Bank**: HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: HSBC
- **to.bank**: HASE
- **channel**: FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

HSBC Referral,5,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 56000.00
   - Currency: HKD
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

  - Date: 2024-11-12
  - Amount: 50000.00
  - Currency: HKD
  - Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Originator Bank: HSBC
  - Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Beneficiary Bank: HASE
  - Channel: CWTF -> FPS

  - Originator Bank: HSBC
  - Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Beneficiary Bank: HASE
  - Channel: CWTF -> FPS

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Both transactions have been matched successfully, so we merge the data accordingly.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: HSBC
  - `to.bank`: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - CWTF -> FPS

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 93,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 90,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Originator Bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 93,000.00
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

Matching CSV record:
- Transaction ID: d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7

#### Transaction 2:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 90,000.00
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

Matching CSV record:
- Transaction ID: 1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 93,000.00
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- To:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS (based on CWTF in CSV)
- can_be_located: true
- transaction_references: [d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7]

#### Transaction 2:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 90,000.00
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- To:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS (based on CWTF in CSV)
- can_be_located: true
- transaction_references: [1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No additional rules need to be applied beyond what was already considered in the previous steps.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON represents the consolidated data from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records, following the specified steps and rules.",2904.0,1411.0,True,True,True
HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 200,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2024-11-12
   - Amount: 100,000.00
   - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
   - Originator Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 200,000.00
- **Exact Match:** Found in CSV with Transaction ID `7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8`

#### Transaction 2: 100,000.00
- **Exact Match:** Found in CSV with Transaction ID `fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 200,000.00
- **Transaction References:** `[""7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8""]`
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 200000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- **To:**
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel:** FPS (based on CWTF in CSV)

#### Transaction 2: 100,000.00
- **Transaction References:** `[""fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93""]`
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 100000
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From:**
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC
- **To:**
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel:** FPS (based on CWTF in CSV)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No additional rules need to be applied beyond what was already considered in the merging process.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,5,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transactions with both date and amount:

| Transaction Date | Beneficiary A/C number | Beneficiary Name | Beneficiary Bank | Originator A/C number | Originator Name | Originator Bank | Currency / Amount |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match each transaction to the CSV records based on the date, amount, originator account, and beneficiary account.

#### Matches Found:
1. **2024-11-12, HKD77,000.00**: `c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432`

7. **2024-11-12, HKD25,500.00**: `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`
8. **2024-11-12, HKD90,000.00**: `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`
9. **2024-11-11, HKD19,990.00**: `47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transactions, we merge the data from the CSV and the fraud alert source.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the bank and channel rules as specified.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output:

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source and matches them with the CSV records, applying the necessary rules and formatting.",3963.0,3306.0,True,True,True
HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the transaction data.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract the transaction details:

- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 16500.00
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

#### Exact Match Search:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 16500
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101

From the CSV, we find the matching transaction:

```csv
2024-11-12,HKD,16500,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK,16500,98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
```

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV values for all transaction fields and filling in missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- **Transaction ID**: 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 16500
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Originator Bank**: HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: CWTF → FPS

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: HSBC
- **to.bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""AP-Impersonation (Other)"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-12"",

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: 20000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a transaction in the CSV that matches the extracted details:
- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: 20000
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601 (or Originator Name: YEUNG KAI)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101 (or Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN)

Scanning through the CSV, we find the following matching transaction:

- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID**: 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741

Since there is no exact match for the originator account number or name, we will use the closest match based on the beneficiary account number and date.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV transaction details and merging with the fraud alert source details:
- **Transaction ID**: 56c5d066-25a6-46bf-8210-f63fbfc37741
- **Date**: 2024-08-25
- **Amount**: 20000 (from fraud alert source)
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: YEUNG KAI (from fraud alert source)
- **Originator Account Number**: 666-66666-601 (from fraud alert source)
- **Originator Bank**: HSBC (rule)
- **Beneficiary Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE (rule)
- **Channel**: FPS (based on Transaction Source: CWTF)

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:

- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** HKD25,900.00
- **Originator Account Number:** 333-333333-101
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search the CSV for a matching transaction based on the extracted details:

- **Channel:** ""Branch""

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output:

Police Letter,2,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- Date: 2024-08-28
- Amount: 50000
- Transferor's Bank and Account: NA CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with Date: 2024-08-28 and Amount: 50000.

#### CSV Matching:
- **CSV Record**: 
  - Date: 2024-08-28
  - Amount: 50000
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102
  - Originator Name: MR    CHUNG SIU
  - Transaction ID: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6

This matches the reported transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we merge the data:
- **Transaction ID**: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- **Date**: 2024-08-28
- **Amount**: 50000
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - Name: null (since it's a cash transaction)
  - Account Number: null
  - Bank: null
- **To**:
  - Name: MR    CHUNG SIU
  - Account Number: 111-111111-102
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel**: cash (based on the description ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"")

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel**: ""cash"" (as per the rules for cash transactions)
- **From.bank**: null (cash transaction)
- **From.name**: null (cash transaction)
- **To.bank**: ""HASE"" (as per the rules)

Since the date and amount match, and the beneficiary account number matches the account number in the fraud alert, we can use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data:
- Transaction ID: bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1
- Originator Name: null (since it's a cash deposit)
- Originator Account Number: null (since it's a cash deposit)
- Originator Bank: null (since it's a cash deposit)
- Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN (from the fraud alert)
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Beneficiary Bank: HASE (as per the rule)
- Channel: cash (based on the transaction code description)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- Since the originator bank and name contain ""cash deposit,"" we set:
  - `channel` to ""cash""
  - `from.bank` to null
  - `from.name` to null

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Money Laundering (implied from the context)
- **Police Reference**: Policeref1
- **Police Team**: District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

Police Letter,10,10,1,"[1, 3]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Bank:** Heng Sang Bank
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file for the extracted transaction. The CSV file contains the following relevant transaction:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Originating Amount:** 25500
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

Since the date, amount, and originator account number match, we can use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data, we merge the fields:
- **Transaction ID:** 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9
- **Date:** 2024-06-29
- **Amount:** 25500
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Transaction Code Description:** ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Cash Transaction Rules:
- No mention of ""cash"" in originator bank or name, so no changes needed.

#### Bank Rules:
- **from.bank:** Heng Sang Bank (as per source)
- **to.bank:** HASE (as per rule)

#### Channel Rules:
- Based on ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT,"" the channel is ""ATM"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Police Reference Rules:
- **Police Reference:** Policeref1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the extracted and processed data, the final JSON output is:

```json

Police Letter,12,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- Date: 2024-07-17
- Amount: 9000
- Originator: CASH CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with Date: 2024-07-17 and Amount: 9000.

#### CSV Transactions:
1. **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
   - Date: 2024-07-17
   - Amount: 30000
   - Originator: CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - Beneficiary: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

2. **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
   - Date: 2024-07-17
   - Amount: 9000
   - Originator: CASH CASH
   - Beneficiary: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

3. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - Date: 2024-07-15
   - Amount: 40000
   - Originator: CASH CASH
   - Beneficiary: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

The exact match is found in the second transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV:
- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
- Date: 2024-07-17
- Amount: 9000
- Originator: CASH CASH
- Beneficiary: CHAN TAI MAN
- Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** ""cash"" (based on the transaction code description)
- **from.bank:** null (since originator is ""CASH CASH"")
- **from.name:** null (since originator is ""CASH CASH"")
- **to.bank:** ""HASE"" (as per rule)
- **to.name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **to.account_number:** 111-111111-101

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Money Laundering (implied from the context)
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF1
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

      ]
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2024-07-15 | 40000  | CASH CASH                    |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with date `2024-07-15` and amount `40000`.

#### CSV Transactions:
1. **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
   - Date: 2024-07-17
   - Amount: 30000
   - Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

2. **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
   - Date: 2024-07-17
   - Amount: 9000
   - Originator Account Number: 
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Originator Name: 
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

3. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - Date: 2024-07-15
   - Amount: 40000
   - Originator Account Number: 
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
   - Originator Name: 
   - Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

The transaction with date `2024-07-15` and amount `40000` matches the third CSV transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** ""cash"" (based on the description ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"")
- **from.bank:** null (since the originator bank is ""CASH CASH"")
- **from.name:** null (since the originator name is ""CASH CASH"")
- **to.bank:** ""HASE"" (as per the rule)

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Money Laundering (implied from the context)
- **Police Reference:** POLICEREF2
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2 Eastern District North Point Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Money Laundering"",
  ""police_reference"": ""POLICEREF2"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2 Eastern District North Point Police Station"",

Search Warrant,6,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

However, since the CSV file is empty, we won't be able to find any matches for the transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source. Therefore, the `can_be_located` field for each transaction will be set to `false`, and the `transaction_references` will be an empty list.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
There are no specific transactions mentioned in the provided fraud alert source with both date and amount. Hence, we cannot extract any transactions.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since there are no transactions to extract, this step is not applicable.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify transactions with both date and amount. However, the provided source does not contain explicit transaction details with dates and amounts. Therefore, we will proceed to the next step without extracting any transactions from the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source, we will directly use the transactions from the CSV file and attempt to match them based on the criteria provided.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will extract the relevant fields from the CSV and merge them with the fraud alert source where applicable.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

We will apply the specified rules for bank names, channels, and other fields.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

We will extract the global fields from the fraud alert source and apply the necessary rules.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

We will construct the final JSON output based on the processed data.

Here is the final JSON output:

This JSON output consolidates the transaction records from the CSV file and applies the necessary rules and mappings as per the instructions.",3150.0,2031.0,False,False,True
Search Warrant,25,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the provided fraud alert source, there are no explicit transactions mentioned with both date and amount. Therefore, we cannot proceed to Step 2 as there are no transactions to match.

However, let's still extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17(1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210

Since there are no transactions to merge, this step is also skipped.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17(1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210
- **Police Reference**: TSWRN240■■■■
- **Writ No.**: TM12■■■/2024
- **Contact Person**: SGT 2■■■■
- **Police Team**: Detective Police Constable 24■■■ LIU ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given the absence of transactions, the final JSON output will look like this:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17(1) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSWRN240■■■■"",

  ""police_team"": ""Detective Police Constable 24■■■ LIU ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the final JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:
1. **Date:** 2024-08-29
   - **Amount:** 20000 HKD
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
2. **Date:** 2024-08-30
   - **Amount:** 20000 HKD
   - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 2024-08-29, 20000 HKD
- **CSV Match:** Found exact match with `Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab`
  - **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Beneficiary Name:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Originator Account Number:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

#### Transaction 2: 2024-08-30, 20000 HKD
- **CSV Match:** Found exact match with `Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014`
  - **Originator Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
  - **Beneficiary Name:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Originator Account Number:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Transaction Code Description:** ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 2024-08-29, 20000 HKD
- **Transaction References:** [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - **Account Number:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **To:**
  - **Name:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-101
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM (since source mentions ATM)

#### Transaction 2: 2024-08-30, 20000 HKD
- **Transaction References:** [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR CHUNG SIU
  - **Account Number:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **To:**
  - **Name:** (not provided in CSV, use source)
  - **Account Number:** 111-111111-102
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM (since source mentions ATM)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Payments(Authorised/Scams)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - From Bank: HASE
  - To Bank: HASE

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Both transactions have the channel ""cash deposits via ATM""

- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:**
  - No specific cancellation amount requested, so set to null for both transactions.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transaction details:
- Date: 10 July 2024
- Amount: HKD 1.00
- Originator Name: MISS YEUNG KAI
- Beneficiary Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Originator Account Number: 01211■■■■■■■
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file:
- Date: 2024-07-10
- Amount: 1.00
- Originator Name: MISS YEUNG KAI
- Beneficiary Name: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- Originator Account Number: Not available in CSV
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

The CSV record matches the date, amount, and beneficiary account number. We can use this record.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record:
- Transaction ID: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d
- Originator Name: MISS YEUNG KAI
- Beneficiary Name: Mr CHAN TAI MAN AND OTHERS
- Originator Account Number: 666-66666-601
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Originator Bank: HSBC (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
- Beneficiary Bank: HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- Channel: CWTF → ""Branch""

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: ""External Fraud"" (as per the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- From Bank: HSBC (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
- To Bank: HASE
- Channel: Branch
- Cancel Amount Requested: Full cancellation (HKD 1.00)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records according to the specified rules and schema.",3216.0,766.0,True,True,True
UAR,5,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 25500
- Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Currency: HKD
- Channel: FPS (based on the description mentioning FPS)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the extracted details:

Transaction ID: `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data and enriching it with the fraud alert source details:
- Transaction References: `[1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]`
- From:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101

  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS (from the fraud alert source)
- Can Be Located: true
- Cancel Amount Requested: 25381 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- From Bank: HSBC (from the CSV data)
- To Bank: HASE (as specified in the rules)
- Channel: FPS (from the fraud alert source)

This JSON represents the consolidated and processed data according to the provided rules and steps.",4541.0,975.0,True,True,True
UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 77000
- Currency: HKD
- Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Channel: FPS (based on the description mentioning FPS)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

Matching transaction from CSV:
- Transaction Date: 2024-11-12
- Originating Amount: 77000
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Transaction ID: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- **Transaction References**: [c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432]
- **Originator Name**: CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number**: 333-333333-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 111-111111-101
- **Originator Bank**: HSBC (from the CSV)
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel**: FPS (from the CSV)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 20000 (as specified in the source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 11/11/2024
- Amount: HKD 19,990.00
- Originator Account: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101
- Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the extracted details:
- Date: 2024-11-11
- Amount: 19990
- Originator Account: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account: 111-111111-101

Matching CSV record:
```csv
2024-11-11,HKD,19990,C,Hang Seng Bank Ltd.,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited,333-333333-101,111-111111-101,CHAN TAI MAN,MR        CHAN TAI MAN,Beneficiary,CWTF,Default transaction,,The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited    HK,19990,47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7
```

Transaction ID: `47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data:
- Transaction References: `[""47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7""]`
- From:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC (from originator bank raw: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited)
- To:
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: CWTF → ""FPS""
- Cancel Amount Requested: Full cancellation (as per fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: External Fraud (from fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- Bank Rules:
  - From Bank: HSBC
  - To Bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-11-11"",

UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""string | null"", // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. However, the source does not provide specific dates for the transactions. Therefore, we cannot extract any transactions based on the given information.

Since no transactions can be extracted due to missing date information, we will proceed with the assumption that no transactions can be located.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted in Step 1, we will skip this step.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no transactions were matched, this step is also skipped.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type Rules:
- The fraud type mentioned in the source is ""External Fraud"".
- Since it is not ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we will use the provided value.

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since no transactions were matched, this step is also skipped.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given that no transactions could be extracted or matched, the final JSON will include the global field and an empty list of transactions.

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""

- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

      ""cancel_amount_requested"": null
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the data as requested.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we have the following transaction details:
- Date: 21-Aug-2024
- Amount: HKD1244
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, and originator/beneficiary information.

#### CSV Record:
- Transaction Date: 2024-08-21
- Originating Amount: 1244
- Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101

There is an exact match in the CSV file with the following details:
- Transaction ID: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV record, we will merge the data and fill in the necessary fields.

#### Merged Data:
- Date: 2024-08-21
- Amount: 1244
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
  - Account Number: 222-222222-101
  - Bank: HASE (as per the source file)
- To:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: ATM (based on the Transaction Code Description in CSV)
- Can Be Located: true
- Cancel Amount Requested: null (since no specific cancellation amount was mentioned)
- Transaction References: [840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719]

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- The fraud type in the source is ""External Fraud"". Since it does not fall under ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"", we will use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- From Bank: HASE (as per the source file)
- To Bank: HASE (as per the source file)

#### Channel Rules:
- Channel: ATM (based on the Transaction Code Description in CSV)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-08-21"",

UAR,25,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

      ""cancel_amount_requested"": 17833
    }
  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 2024-11-08
- Amount: 25900
- Currency: HKD
- Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
- Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
- Channel: FPS (based on the description mentioning FPS)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match the extracted transaction to the CSV record:
- **CSV Record**: 
  - Transaction Date: 2024-11-08
  - Originating Currency: HKD
  - Originating Amount: 25900
  - Originator Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Originator Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Beneficiary Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

Since the transaction details match exactly, we can use the Transaction ID `c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data and enriching it with the fraud alert source details:
- **Transaction References**: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]
- **From**:
  - Name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 333-333333-101
  - Bank: HSBC (based on the originator bank raw data)
- **To**:
  - Name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - Account Number: 111-111111-101
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS (based on the CSV Transaction Type Source)
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 17833 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - From Bank: HSBC (from the originator bank raw data)
  - To Bank: HASE (as specified in the fraud alert source)
- **Channel Rules**: FPS (from the CSV Transaction Type Source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

  ]
}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. However, there are no explicit transactions mentioned with both date and amount in the provided text. Therefore, we will proceed based on the available transaction records from the CSV.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will match the transactions from the CSV to the reported transactions. Since there are no specific transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source, we will consider the transactions in the CSV.

#### Transaction 1:
- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 30000
- **Originator Account Number:** 222-222222-101
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG TAK SHING
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4

This transaction matches the criteria since it involves the originator account number and name provided in the fraud alert source.

#### Transaction 2:
- **Date:** 2024-07-17
- **Amount:** 9000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f

This transaction does not match the originator account number and name provided in the fraud alert source.

#### Transaction 3:
- **Date:** 2024-07-15
- **Amount:** 40000
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 111-111111-101
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106

This transaction does not match the originator account number and name provided in the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data for the matched transaction (Transaction 1).

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** The fraud type is ""AP-Impersonation (Others)"". According to the rules, we should look for other fraud type hints in the document. Since there are none, we will use ""Impersonation"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules:**
  - `from.bank`: ""HASE"" (Victim ODFT)
  - `to.bank`: ""HASE"" (Suspect ODFT)

- **Channel Rules:**
  - Based on the transaction code description ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"", the channel is ""ATM"".

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

}",1,1,0,,,,"Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant information is:

- Two transactions of HKD 46,000 each on December 10 and December 11, 2024.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match these transactions to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: HKD 46,000 on 2024-12-10
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with `Transaction Date (value)` as `2024-12-10`, `Originating Amount` as `46000`, and `Originator Account Number` as `222-222222-101`.
- **Transaction ID**: `6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`

#### Transaction 2: HKD 46,000 on 2024-12-11
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with `Transaction Date (value)` as `2024-12-11`, `Originating Amount` as `46000`, and `Originator Account Number` as `222-222222-101`.
- **Transaction ID**: `dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will merge the data from the CSV into the transactions extracted from the fraud alert source.

#### Transaction 1: HKD 46,000 on 2024-12-10
- **Transaction ID**: `6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`
- **Date**: `2024-12-10`
- **Amount**: `46000`
- **Currency**: `HKD`
- **From**:
  - **Name**: `CHUNG SIU`
  - **Account Number**: `222-222222-101`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Victim ODFT)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: ``
  - **Account Number**: `333-333333-102`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Suspect ODFT)
- **Channel**: `ATM` (based on `Transaction Code Description`)

#### Transaction 2: HKD 46,000 on 2024-12-11
- **Transaction ID**: `dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`
- **Date**: `2024-12-11`
- **Amount**: `46000`
- **Currency**: `HKD`
- **From**:
  - **Name**: `CHEUNG TAK SHING`
  - **Account Number**: `222-222222-101`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Victim ODFT)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: `CHAN, TAIMAN`
  - **Account Number**: `111-111111-101`
  - **Bank**: `HASE` (Suspect ODFT)
- **Channel**: `ATM` (based on `Transaction Code Description`)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""Others"". Since there are no specific hints in the document, we will use ""Not provided"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**: Already applied in the merging step.
- **Channel Rules**: Already applied based on the `Transaction Code Description`.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transactions from the fraud alert source and matches them with the CSV records, applying all necessary rules and transformations.",3419.0,1347.0,False,False,True
ADCC,307,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **C RN 3547 (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source and matches them to the CSV records, applying all necessary rules and transformations.",3880.0,5835.0,False,False,False
ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **STRN4150 (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:

- Date: 2024-01-20
- Currency: HKD
- Amount: 114104
- Originator Bank: BOC (Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited)
- Originator Account Number: 59407816184
- Originator Name: ZHAO WEI HONG
- Beneficiary Bank: HSB (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- Beneficiary Account Number: 949-759176-733
- Beneficiary Name: TANG SIU KWAN

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match this transaction to the CSV record:

CSV Record:
- Transaction Date: 2024-01-20
- Originating Currency: HKD
- Originating Amount: 114104
- Originator Bank Raw: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- Originator Account Number: 59407816184
- Originator Name: ZHAO WEI HONG
- Beneficiary Bank Raw: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- Beneficiary Account Number: 949-759176-733
- Beneficiary Name: TANG SIU KWAN
- Transaction ID: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff

Since all fields match, we can use the Transaction ID `9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data and enriching with the fraud alert source values where necessary:

- Transaction ID: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff
- Date: 2024-01-20
- Currency: HKD
- Amount: 114104
- From:
  - Name: ZHAO WEI HONG
  - Account Number: 59407816184
  - Bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- To:
  - Name: TANG SIU KWAN
  - Account Number: 949-759176-733
  - Bank: HASE (Hang Seng Bank Ltd.)
- Channel: CWTF (Branch)
- Can Be Located: true

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- Channel: Based on the Transaction Source in CSV, ""CWTF"" maps to ""Branch"".
- Bank Names: Correctly mapped as per the rules.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: Social Media Deception
- Police Reference: STRN4150 (E-HUB-■■■)
- Police Team: E-HUB-■■■

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** __PLACEHOLDER_1__
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO TAI KEUNG
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 844-392003-248
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file based on the extracted details.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Originating Amount:** 1
- **Originator Account Number:** 225-26771-196
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 844-392003-248
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr HO TAI KEUNG AND OTHERS
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

The CSV record matches the transaction details from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data and fill in the missing fields from the fraud alert source.

#### Merged Data:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-07-10
- **Amount:** 1.00
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** MR CHAN TAI MAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 225-26771-196
- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name:** Mr HO TAI KEUNG AND OTHERS
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 844-392003-248
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Transaction ID:** b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Based on the rules provided:
- **Channel:** CWTF → ""Branch""

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output according to the schema.

HSBC Referral,1805,5,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Currency:** HKD (assumed based on context)
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** NIL
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file with the same date, amount, and originator/beneficiary details.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Name:** HO WING KEI

From the CSV, we find the following matching transaction:
- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- **Transaction ID:** 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
- **Date:** 2024-11-12
- **Amount:** 14175
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** HO WING KEI
- **Originator Account Number:** 220-829578-820
- **Originator Bank:** HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name:** MR HO WING KEI
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 246-495796-850
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** CWTF (Branch)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank:** HSBC
- **to.bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** Branch (based on CWTF)

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

This JSON represents the consolidated and enriched data based on the provided fraud alert source and CSV transaction records.",3014.0,1825.0,False,True,False
HSBC Referral,1805,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: `2024-11-12`
   - Amount: `90845`
   - Originator Account Number: `130-254021-474`
   - Originator Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`
   - Beneficiary Account Number: `244-182830-350`
   - Beneficiary Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: `2024-11-12`
   - Amount: `98453`
   - Originator Account Number: `130-254021-474`
   - Originator Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`
   - Beneficiary Account Number: `244-182830-350`
   - Beneficiary Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: Date `2024-11-12`, Amount `90845`
- **Exact Match:** Found in CSV with Transaction ID `d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7`

#### Transaction 2: Date `2024-11-12`, Amount `98453`
- **Exact Match:** Found in CSV with Transaction ID `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: Date `2024-11-12`, Amount `90845`
- **Transaction References:** `[d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7]`
- **Originator:**
  - Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`
  - Account Number: `130-254021-474`
  - Bank: `HSBC`
- **Beneficiary:**
  - Name: `MR        TSANG MEI LIN`
  - Account Number: `244-182830-350`
  - Bank: `HASE`
- **Channel:** `FPS` (based on `Transaction Type Source` CWTF)

#### Transaction 2: Date `2024-11-12`, Amount `98453`
- **Transaction References:** `[1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628]`
- **Originator:**
  - Name: `TSANG MEI LIN`
  - Account Number: `130-254021-474`
  - Bank: `HSBC`
- **Beneficiary:**
  - Name: `MR        TSANG MEI LIN`
  - Account Number: `244-182830-350`
  - Bank: `HASE`
- **Channel:** `FPS` (based on `Transaction Type Source` CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No additional rules need to be applied beyond what was already considered in the previous steps.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

This JSON output consolidates the extracted transactions from the fraud alert source, matches them to the CSV records, and applies the necessary rules to ensure accurate representation.",2900.0,1251.0,False,True,False
HSBC Referral,1805,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the transactions with both date and amount:

| Transaction Date | Originator A/C number | Originator Name | Originator Bank | Currency / Amount | Beneficiary A/C number | Beneficiary Name | Beneficiary Bank |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 2024-11-12       | 259-162915-757        | YEUNG KAI CHUNG | HSBC            | 26200             | 132-733521-869         | YEUNG KAI CHUNG | HASE             |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match each transaction to the CSV records based on the date, amount, originator account, and beneficiary account.

#### Matches Found:
1. **2024-11-12, 26200**: `1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03`
2. **2024-11-12, 48509**: `191ec06e-88eb-4ccd-bc9f-c426d9f4d1ab`
3. **2024-11-12, 114485**: `fe57572e-f967-4a0c-9a9d-3315d2ccaf93`
4. **2024-11-12, 87790**: `d1fbfe47-51a4-4db9-83e6-17472b01cad7`
5. **2024-11-12, 244511**: `7b17ff77-05ab-4618-90b1-f5f41deac2a8`
6. **2024-11-12, 111555**: `c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432`
7. **2024-11-12, 48509**: `ecd331fd-3f2b-48af-8102-36e9dd9ba457`
8. **2024-11-12, 57610**: `1ba89dc3-a477-450d-a7f7-bd55469f5628`
9. **2024-11-11, 10259**: `47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transactions, we merge the data from the CSV and the fraud alert source.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Applying the rules for bank codes and channels:

- **from.bank**: Always ""HSBC""
- **to.bank**: Always ""HASE""
- **Channel**: Based on the CSV data, all transactions have the source ""CWTF"", which maps to ""FPS"".

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output:

This JSON output consolidates the transactions from the fraud alert source and matches them with the CSV records, applying the necessary rules and formatting.",3963.0,3220.0,False,True,False
HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 11114
- **Currency**: HKD (assumed based on context)
- **Originator Account Number**: 111-515645-952
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Bank**: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 533-812930-996
- **Beneficiary Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Bank**: Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find an exact match in the CSV file for the transaction with the date `2024-11-12` and amount `11114`.

From the CSV, we find the matching transaction:
- **Transaction Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Originating Amount**: 11114
- **Originator Account Number**: 111-515645-952
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 533-812930-996
- **Transaction ID**: 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV transaction, we merge the data:
- **Transaction ID**: 98d894e4-be10-4096-8afa-21d4d4259d2f
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 11114
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Originator Account Number**: 111-515645-952
- **Originator Bank**: HSBC
- **Beneficiary Name**: MR TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 533-812930-996
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: Branch (based on Transaction Source CWTF)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **from.bank**: HSBC
- **to.bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: Branch

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

HSBC Referral,1807,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** 19086
- **Currency:** HKD (assumed based on context)
- **Originator Account Number:** 498-43624-186
- **Originator Name:** LAM SIU FUNG
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 228-879233-316
- **Beneficiary Name:** TSUI SIU KWAN
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a matching transaction in the CSV file with the same date, amount, and either originator or beneficiary details.

#### Matching Criteria:
- **Date:** 2024-08-25
- **Amount:** 19086
- **Originator Account Number:** 498-43624-186
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 228-879233-316

Checking the CSV file, there is no exact match for the amount 19086. Therefore, we set `can_be_located` to `false` and `transaction_references` to an empty array.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since no exact match was found, we use the extracted data from the fraud alert source and fill in the missing fields with `null`.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

We apply the bank and channel rules as specified.

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 22684
- **Currency:** HKD (assumed based on context)
- **Originator Account Number:** 508-995304-174
- **Originator Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
- **Originator Bank:** The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 328-507081-995
- **Beneficiary Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
- **Beneficiary Bank:** Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (HASE)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search the CSV for a matching transaction:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 22684
- **Originator Account Number:** 508-995304-174
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 328-507081-995

Matching CSV record:
- **Transaction Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Originating Currency:** HKD
- **Originating Amount:** 22684
- **Originator Account Number:** 508-995304-174
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 328-507081-995
- **Transaction ID:** c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

Since there is an exact match, we use the Transaction ID `c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21`.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data:
- **Transaction References:** [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]
- **Date:** 2024-11-08
- **Amount:** 22684
- **Currency:** HKD
- **From (Originator):**
  - **Name:** CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 508-995304-174
  - **Bank:** HSBC
- **To (Beneficiary):**
  - **Name:** MR CHEUNG WEI MING
  - **Account Number:** 328-507081-995
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** CWTF → ""Branch""

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank:** HSBC
- **To Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** ""Branch""

### Step 5: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2552,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- Date: 2024-05-07
- Amount: 27694
- Transferor's Bank and Account: NA CASH

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with Date: 2024-05-07 and Amount: 27694.

#### CSV Matching:
- **CSV Entry**: 
  - Date: 2024-05-07
  - Amount: 27694
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 440-183579-148
  - Originator Name: MR    LAU CHI MING
  - Transaction ID: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6

This entry matches the reported transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched CSV entry, we merge the data:
- **Transaction ID**: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- **Date**: 2024-05-07
- **Amount**: 27694
- **Currency**: HKD
- **Originator Name**: MR    LAU CHI MING
- **Beneficiary Name**: (not specified in CSV, but from source: LAU CHI MING)
- **Originator Account Number**: (not specified in CSV)
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 440-183579-148
- **Originator Bank**: (not specified in CSV, but from source: NA CASH)
- **Beneficiary Bank**: HASE (as per rule)
- **Channel**: cash (as per rule, since originator bank contains ""cash"")

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel**: ""cash""
- **Originator Bank**: null (since it contains ""cash"")
- **Originator Name**: null (since it was the cash reference)
- **Beneficiary Bank**: ""HASE""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Money Laundering (implied from context)
- **Police Reference**: NTK RN 6916
- **Police Team**: District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2559,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- **Date:** 2023-09-15
- **Amount:** 47347

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file for the transaction with the date `2023-09-15` and amount `47347`.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date (value):** 2023-09-15
- **Originating Amount:** 47347
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 782-590061-227
- **Transaction ID:** bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1

This matches the transaction from the fraud alert source.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data:
- **Transaction ID:** bb686b10-b386-4645-a4bb-bd1d4d996bd1
- **Date:** 2023-09-15
- **Amount:** 47347
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Account Number:** (not provided in CSV)
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 782-590061-227
- **Originator Name:** (not provided in CSV)
- **Beneficiary Name:** POON KA WAI (from fraud alert source)
- **Originator Bank Raw:** (not provided in CSV)
- **Beneficiary Bank Raw:** (not provided in CSV)
- **Transaction Code Description:** CIF CASH DEPOSIT

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Cash Transaction Rules:
- Originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  - Set channel to ""cash""
  - Set from.bank to null
  - Set from.name to null

#### Bank Rules:
- from.bank: Not applicable since it's a cash deposit.
- to.bank: ""HASE""

#### Channel Rules:
- Based on Transaction Code Description: ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Police Reference Rules:
- **Police Reference:** C RN 1611

#### Police Team Rules:
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 2, Kwai Tsing District, Kwai Chung Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""Romance Scam"",
  ""police_reference"": ""C RN 1611"",

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:

1. **Transaction 1:**
   - Date: 2025-03-23
   - Amount: 2288
   - Transferor's Bank and Account: Hang Seng Bank 169-960406-832

2. **Transaction 2:**
   - Date: 2025-03-23
   - Amount: 36798
   - Transferor's Bank and Account: Cash Deposit Cash Deposit

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1:
- **Exact Match Criteria:** Date (2025-03-23) + Amount (2288) + Originator Account Number (169-960406-832) + Beneficiary Account Number (978-841875-746)
- **Match Found:** Transaction ID: `7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a`

#### Transaction 2:
- **Exact Match Criteria:** Date (2025-03-23) + Amount (36798) + Originator Account Number (Cash Deposit) + Beneficiary Account Number (676-894073-816)
- **Match Found:** Transaction ID: `ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1:
- **Transaction References:** `[""7a47c599-776e-40fb-80f5-45e585c3291a""]`
- **Originator:** YEUNG HOI SHAN (from CSV)
- **Beneficiary:** CHOW WEI MAN (from CSV)
- **Originator Bank:** Hang Seng Bank (from source)
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE (rule)
- **Channel:** ATM (based on CSV description)

#### Transaction 2:
- **Transaction References:** `[""ed194421-0dd2-4eb4-8f2f-3c85d9d905c6""]`
- **Originator:** null (cash deposit)
- **Beneficiary:** WONG KA MING (from CSV)
- **Originator Bank:** null (cash deposit)
- **Beneficiary Bank:** HASE (rule)
- **Channel:** cash (based on CSV description)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

Both transactions already follow the rules specified.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** Money Laundering (implied from context)
- **Police Reference:** C RN 1049
- **Police Team:** District Investigation Team 4 Mong Kok District Mong Kok Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Police Letter,2561,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 2025-05-13
- Amount: 38186
- Originator Bank: Heng Sang Bank
- Originator Account: 903-280481-143

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV file for the extracted transaction. The CSV file contains the following relevant transaction:
- Date: 2025-05-13
- Amount: 38186
- Originator Account: 903-280481-143
- Beneficiary Account: 361-740216-723
- Originator Name: WU CHI WAI
- Beneficiary Name: LIU MING FUNG
- Transaction ID: 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9

Since the date, amount, and originator account match, we can use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data, we merge the fields:
- Transaction ID: 82511cfe-0f34-4dfe-b337-5b524ef899e9
- Date: 2025-05-13
- Amount: 38186
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: WU CHI WAI
  - Account Number: 903-280481-143
  - Bank: Heng Sang Bank
- To:
  - Name: LIU MING FUNG
  - Account Number: 361-740216-723
  - Bank: HASE (as per rule)
- Channel: ATM (based on Transaction Code Description)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- No cash transaction rules apply here.
- Bank names are correctly set.
- Channel is set to ""ATM"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: Money Laundering (implied from the context)
- **Police Reference**: TSWRN1620
- **Police Team**: District Investigation Team 3, Tuen Mun District, Tuen Mun Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:

| Date       | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| 2025-03-21 | 11895  |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We need to find a match in the CSV for the transaction with date `2025-03-21` and amount `11895`.

#### CSV Records:
1. **Transaction ID:** 2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
   - Date: 2025-03-21
   - Amount: 30000
   - Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
   - Beneficiary Name: YEUNG HOI SHAN
   - Originator Account Number: 222-222222-101
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 504-921376-720
   - Transaction Code Description: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

2. **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
   - Date: 2025-03-21
   - Amount: 11895
   - Originator Name: 
   - Beneficiary Name: YEUNG HOI SHAN
   - Originator Account Number: 
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 504-921376-720
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

3. **Transaction ID:** 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
   - Date: 2024-07-15
   - Amount: 40000
   - Originator Name: 
   - Beneficiary Name: YEUNG HOI SHAN
   - Originator Account Number: 
   - Beneficiary Account Number: 504-921376-720
   - Transaction Code Description: CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

The exact match for the transaction with date `2025-03-21` and amount `11895` is:

- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV:

- **Transaction ID:** 40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f
- **Date:** 2025-03-21
- **Amount:** 11895
- **Currency:** HKD
- **Originator Name:** 
- **Beneficiary Name:** YEUNG HOI SHAN
- **Originator Account Number:** 
- **Beneficiary Account Number:** 504-921376-720
- **Transaction Code Description:** CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Channel:** ""cash"" (based on the transaction code description)
- **from.bank:** null (since there is no originator bank mentioned)
- **from.name:** null (since there is no originator name mentioned)
- **to.bank:** ""HASE"" (as per the rule)

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type:** ""Telephone Deception"" (from the case summary)
- **Police Reference:** ""TSWRN9074"" (extracted from the source document)
- **Police Team:** ""District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station"" (extracted from the source document)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Telephone Deception"",
  ""police_reference"": ""TSWRN9074"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 5, Mong Kok District, Mong Kok Police Station"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2025-03-21"",
      ""amount"": 11895,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": null,
        ""account_number"": null,
        ""bank"": null
      },
      ""to"": {
        ""name"": ""YEUNG HOI SHAN"",
        ""account_number"": ""504-921376-720"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""
      },
      ""channel"": ""cash"",
      ""can_be_located"": true,
      ""transaction_references"": [""40a3a6a4-78d6-4031-aa6c-7b536057a13f""]

Police Letter,2562,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Grand Total: 19 replacements","Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant transaction details are:

| Date       | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| 2023-09-20 | 27947  |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match this transaction to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: 2023-09-20, 27947
- **CSV Record**: 
  - Date: 2023-09-20
  - Amount: 27947
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 549-818437-223
  - Originator Account Number: Not provided
  - Originator Name: Not provided
  - Beneficiary Name: CHIU KA YAN
  - Transaction ID: 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106

This transaction matches the criteria (same date and amount).

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we will merge the data:

- **Transaction ID**: 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
- **Date**: 2023-09-20
- **Amount**: 27947
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - Name: null (since originator name is not provided)
  - Account Number: null (since originator account number is not provided)
  - Bank: null (since originator bank is not provided)
- **To**:
  - Name: CHIU KA YAN
  - Account Number: 549-818437-223
  - Bank: HASE (as per rule)
- **Channel**: cash (based on ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"")
- **can_be_located**: true
- **transaction_references**: [""798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106""]

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

No additional adjustments are needed for this transaction as the rules are already applied.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

Extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: Employment Fraud
- **Police Reference**: YLRN 7262
- **Police Team**: District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Employment Fraud"",
  ""police_reference"": ""YLRN 7262"",
  ""police_team"": ""District Investigation Team 2, Eastern District, North Point Police Station"",

Search Warrant,3306,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Grand Total: 6 replacements","Given the provided fraud alert source and the empty CSV file, we need to follow the steps outlined to create the final JSON output. However, since the CSV file is empty, we won't be able to find any matches for the transactions mentioned in the fraud alert source. Therefore, the `can_be_located` field for each transaction will be set to `false`, and the `transaction_references` will be an empty list.

Let's go through the steps:

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the provided fraud alert source, there are no specific transactions mentioned with both date and amount. Hence, we cannot extract any transactions.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since there are no transactions to extract, this step is not applicable.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
No transactions to merge.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
No transactions to apply rules to.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We can extract the global fields from the fraud alert source:

- **Fraud Type**: ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210""
- **Police Reference**: ""HH RN 4568""
- **Writ No.**: ""0118099""
- **Contact Person**: ""PC7660""
- **Police Team**: ""Detective Police Constable 15■■■ CHENG ■■■■■■ of District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force""

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
Since there are no transactions to include, the `alerted_transactions` array will be empty.

Here is the final JSON output:

Grand Total: 6 replacements","Let's follow the steps outlined to process the given documents and generate the required JSON output.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source
From the fraud alert source, we need to identify transactions with both date and amount. However, the provided source does not contain any explicit transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we will proceed without any transactions extracted from the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV
Since no transactions were extracted from the source, we will assume that we need to match all transactions in the CSV file based on the criteria provided.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction
We will now merge the data from the CSV file and apply the necessary rules.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules
We will apply the bank and channel rules to each transaction.

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules
We will extract the global fields from the fraud alert source and apply the necessary rules.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
We will construct the final JSON output based on the processed data.

Here is the final JSON output:

Search Warrant,3325,25,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to identify transactions with both date and amount. However, the provided source does not contain any explicit transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we will move to the next step without extracting any transactions from the source.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since no transactions were extracted from the source, we will directly use the CSV data to create the JSON structure.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

We will use the CSV data to populate the transaction details.

### Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- `from.bank`: The originator bank is ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (HSBC).
- `to.bank`: The beneficiary bank is ""Hang Seng Bank Ltd."" (HASE).

#### Channel Rules:
- Based on the `Transaction Type Source` and `Transaction Code Description`, the channel is ""FPS"".

### Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type Rules:
- The fraud type mentioned is ""Obtaining Property By Deception"". Since this is an offence type, we will look for other fraud type hints in the document. There are no other hints, so we will use ""Not provided"".

#### Police Reference Rules:
- The police reference is ""KCRN3539"".

#### Police Team Rules:
- The police team information is ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District"".

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Now, let's construct the final JSON output based on the extracted and processed data.

- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transactions:
1. **Date:** 29-August-2024, **Amount:** HKD12831, **Beneficiary Account Number:** 992-535728-826
2. **Date:** 30-August-2024, **Amount:** HKD12831, **Beneficiary Account Number:** 985-735588-214

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

#### Transaction 1: 29-August-2024, HKD12831, Beneficiary Account Number: 992-535728-826
- **CSV Match:** Found exact match in the CSV with `Transaction ID: d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab`

#### Transaction 2: 30-August-2024, HKD12831, Beneficiary Account Number: 985-735588-214
- **CSV Match:** Found exact match in the CSV with `Transaction ID: 4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014`

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: 29-August-2024, HKD12831, Beneficiary Account Number: 992-535728-826
- **Transaction References:** [d144dec7-8032-463c-b66c-21caed6abdab]
- **From:** 
  - **Name:** MR YIP HOI MAN
  - **Account Number:** Not provided
  - **Bank:** Not provided
- **To:**
  - **Name:** Not provided
  - **Account Number:** 992-535728-826
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM (since the description mentions ATM and the source file mentions ATM)

#### Transaction 2: 30-August-2024, HKD12831, Beneficiary Account Number: 985-735588-214
- **Transaction References:** [4064485e-8e70-4cf1-9303-99ba85cc0014]
- **From:**
  - **Name:** MR LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number:** Not provided
  - **Bank:** Not provided
- **To:**
  - **Name:** Not provided
  - **Account Number:** 985-735588-214
  - **Bank:** HASE
- **Channel:** cash deposits via ATM (since the description mentions ATM and the source file mentions ATM)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- From the source: ""External Fraud""
- Since it matches ""External Fraud"", we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- For both transactions, the `to.bank` is ""HASE"".
- The `from.bank` is not provided in the source or CSV, so it remains null.

#### Channel Rules:
- Both transactions have the channel ""cash deposits via ATM"".

#### Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested:
- No specific cancellation amount is mentioned, so `cancel_amount_requested` is null for both transactions.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

This JSON output consolidates the information from the fraud alert source and the CSV transaction records according to the specified rules and schema.",2579.0,1257.0,False,False,False
UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""

    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 10 JUL 2024
- Amount: HKD 1.00

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date and amount, along with either the originator or beneficiary account number.

#### CSV Record:
- Transaction Date: 2024-07-10
- Originating Amount: 1
- Originator Account Number: 696-87403-304
- Beneficiary Account Number: 482-391974-358
- Originator Name: MISS SIN WEI HONG
- Beneficiary Name: Mr LI HOK MING AND OTHERS
- Transaction ID: b7f9e8c1-b04e-4077-99b4-a53517b57e4d

The transaction matches the date and amount, and the beneficiary account number also matches.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV record, we merge the data and fill in the necessary fields.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- From the source: ""External Fraud""
- No other fraud type hints are present, so we use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

#### Bank Rules:
- `from.bank`: The originator bank is ""The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited"" (HSBC).
- `to.bank`: Always ""HASE"".

#### Channel Rules:
- Based on the Transaction Code Description: ""Default transaction"" does not map to any specific channel, so it remains `null`.

#### Special Handling for `cancel_amount_requested`:
- The fraud alert source requests cancellation of the payment, so we assume a full cancellation of the payment.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Combining all the information, the final JSON output is:

```json

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

UAR,4305,5,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 26830
- Originator Account Number: 326-186461-555
- Beneficiary Account Number: 382-657343-701
- Originator Name: LAM HOI SHAN
- Beneficiary Name: LAM HOI SHAN
- Channel: FPS (based on the description mentioning FPS)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

#### Matching Criteria:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 26830
- Originator Account Number: 326-186461-555
- Beneficiary Account Number: 382-657343-701

From the CSV, we find the following matching transaction:
- Transaction ID: 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- **Transaction References**: [1fd993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]
- **Date**: 2024-11-12
- **Amount**: 26830
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number**: 326-186461-555
  - **Bank**: HSBC (based on the bank code mapping)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MR LAM HOI SHAN
  - **Account Number**: 382-657343-701
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 25381 (as specified in the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (since it is explicitly mentioned in the source and does not fall under ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"", or ""External Fraud"")

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: HSBC (based on the bank code mapping)
- **To Bank**: HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel**: FPS (as per the rule)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 39938
- Originator Account Number: 467-941316-646
- Beneficiary Account Number: 916-632151-107
- Originator Name: MOK SIU YING
- Beneficiary Name: MOK SIU YING
- Currency: HKD
- Channel: FPS (based on the description mentioning ""FPS PAYMENT"")

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

Matching transaction in CSV:
- Transaction Date: 2024-11-12
- Originating Amount: 39938
- Originator Account Number: 467-941316-646
- Beneficiary Account Number: 916-632151-107
- Transaction ID: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- Transaction ID: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432
- Date: 2024-11-12
- Amount: 39938
- Currency: HKD
- From:
  - Name: MOK SIU YING
  - Account Number: 467-941316-646
  - Bank: HSBC (from the CSV data)
- To:
  - Name: MR MOK SIU YING
  - Account Number: 916-632151-107
  - Bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS (from the fraud alert source)
- Can Be Located: true
- Cancel Amount Requested: 20000 (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- Fraud Type: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- From Bank: HSBC (from the CSV data)
- To Bank: HASE (as per the rule)
- Channel: FPS (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

```json

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 11/11/2024
- Amount: 2353.49
- Originator Account Number: 542-170681-918
- Beneficiary Account Number: 969-984363-416
- Originator Name: WONG KA MING
- Beneficiary Name: WONG KA MING
- Currency: HKD
- Channel: FPS (based on the reference to FPS in the fraud alert)

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now search for an exact match in the CSV file based on the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number.

#### Matching Criteria:
- Date: 2024-11-11
- Amount: 2353.49
- Originator Account Number: 542-170681-918
- Beneficiary Account Number: 969-984363-416

From the CSV, we find the following matching transaction:
- Transaction ID: 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the matched transaction from the CSV, we merge the data:

- **Transaction References**: [47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7]
- **Date**: 2024-11-11
- **Amount**: 2353.49
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: WONG KA MING
  - **Account Number**: 542-170681-918
  - **Bank**: HSBC (from the CSV data)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: MR WONG KA MING
  - **Account Number**: 969-984363-416
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS (from the fraud alert source)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 2353.49 (full cancellation requested)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: HSBC (from the CSV data)
- **To Bank**: HASE (as per the rule)
- **Channel**: FPS (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",

This JSON represents the consolidated information from the fraud alert source and the matched transaction record from the CSV file.",4117.0,882.0,False,True,False
UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. However, the provided source does not contain any explicit transactions with both date and amount. Therefore, we cannot proceed to Step 2 as there are no transactions to match.

Since there are no transactions to extract, the final JSON output will include the fraud type and an empty list for `alerted_transactions`.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

Since there are no transactions to match, this step is skipped.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Since there are no transactions to merge, this step is also skipped.

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

From the fraud alert source, the fraud type is ""External Fraud"". According to the rules, we should look for other fraud type hints in the document. Since there are no other hints, we will use ""External Fraud"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

Since there are no transactions, this step is skipped.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Given the absence of transactions, the final JSON output will be:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""External Fraud"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": []
}
```

Grand Total: 14 replacements","Let's follow the step-by-step process to extract and consolidate the data as described.

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction:
- **Date**: 21-Aug-2024
- **Amount**: HKD1651
- **Originator Name**: Mr Cheung
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808
- **Channel**: ATM

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match this transaction to the CSV record.

#### CSV Record:
- **Transaction Date (value)**: 2024-08-21
- **Originating Currency**: HKD
- **Originating Amount**: 1651
- **Originator Account Number**: 723-330881-476
- **Beneficiary Account Number**: 819-444432-808
- **Originator Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
- **Beneficiary Name**: HO WING KEI
- **Transaction Code Description**: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT
- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

Since the date and amount match, and the beneficiary account number matches, we have an exact match.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data and enriching it with the fraud alert source data where necessary:

- **Transaction ID**: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719
- **Date**: 2024-08-21
- **Amount**: 1651
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - **Name**: TSANG MEI LIN
  - **Account Number**: 723-330881-476
  - **Bank**: HASE (since the originator bank code is not provided, we use the bank mentioned in the source)
- **To**:
  - **Name**: HO WING KEI
  - **Account Number**: 819-444432-808
  - **Bank**: HASE
- **Channel**: ATM
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: null (no specific cancellation amount requested)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as per the source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **From Bank**: HASE (as per the source)
- **To Bank**: HASE (as per the source)
- **Channel**: ATM (as per the source and CSV)

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

UAR,4325,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we extract the following transaction details:
- Date: 2024-11-08
- Amount: 23221
- Originator Name: CHOW WEI MAN
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHOW WEI MAN
- Originator Account Number: 364-913634-340
- Beneficiary Account Number: 689-590116-505
- Currency: HKD
- Partial Amount to Cancel: 14143.95

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We now match this transaction to the CSV record:
- **CSV Record**: 
  - Transaction Date: 2024-11-08
  - Originating Currency: HKD
  - Originating Amount: 23221
  - Originator Account Number: 364-913634-340
  - Beneficiary Account Number: 689-590116-505
  - Originator Name: CHOW WEI MAN
  - Beneficiary Name: MR CHOW WEI MAN
  - Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21

Since the date, amount, originator account number, and beneficiary account number match, we have a valid match.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Using the CSV data and enriching it with the fraud alert source details:
- **Transaction References**: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]
- **Date**: 2024-11-08
- **Amount**: 23221
- **Currency**: HKD
- **From**:
  - Name: CHOW WEI MAN
  - Account Number: 364-913634-340
  - Bank: HSBC (based on the bank code mapping)
- **To**:
  - Name: MR CHOW WEI MAN
  - Account Number: 689-590116-505
  - Bank: HASE
- **Channel**: FPS (based on the Transaction Source in CSV)
- **Can Be Located**: true
- **Cancel Amount Requested**: 14143.95

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: External Fraud (as per the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**: Applied as described above.
- **Channel Rules**: Applied as described above.
- **Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested**: Applied as described above.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant information is:

- Date: 2024-07-17
- Amount: 16256

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now search for the exact match in the CSV file based on the date and amount.

#### Transaction to Match:
- Date: 2024-07-17
- Amount: 16256

#### CSV Records:
```csv
Transaction Date (value),Originating Currency,Originating Amount,Debit Credit Indicator,Beneficiary Bank Raw,Originator Bank Raw,Originator Account Number,Beneficiary Account Number,Originator Name,Beneficiary Name,Subject Type,Transaction Type Source,Transaction Code Description,Sending Bank Account Number,Sending Bank Address,Converted Amount,Transaction ID
2024-07-17,HKD,16256,C,,,862-513276-255,626-906866-114,MA CHI KEUNG,LI WEI HONG,Beneficiary,CUTF,ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED   DEPOSIT,,,16256,2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4
```

This record matches the date and amount exactly. Therefore, we will use this transaction.

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

Extract the transaction references and use CSV values for all transaction fields.

#### Merged Data:
- Transaction ID: `2810da47-1684-450f-94d9-aef6064774b4`
- Date: `2024-07-17`
- Amount: `16256`
- Currency: `HKD`
- From:
  - Name: `MA CHI KEUNG`
  - Account Number: `862-513276-255`
  - Bank: `HASE` (Victim ODFT)
- To:
  - Name: `LI WEI HONG`
  - Account Number: `626-906866-114`
  - Bank: `HASE` (Suspect ODFT)
- Channel: `ATM` (based on `ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT`)

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

#### Fraud Type:
- Fraud Type: `Impersonation` (from the fraud alert source)

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

All rules have been applied in the previous steps.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON

Finally, we construct the JSON output:

```json
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""Impersonation"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [
    {
      ""date"": ""2024-07-17"",
      ""amount"": 16256,
      ""currency"": ""HKD"",
      ""from"": {
        ""name"": ""MA CHI KEUNG"",
        ""account_number"": ""862-513276-255"",
        ""bank"": ""HASE""

ODFT,5070,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

### Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source

From the fraud alert source, we need to extract transactions with both date and amount. The relevant information is:

- Two transactions of HKD 47111 each on December 10 and December 11, 2024.

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

We will now match these transactions to the CSV records.

#### Transaction 1: HKD 47111 on 2024-12-10
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with `Transaction ID`: `6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66`
- **Details**:
  - `Transaction Date`: 2024-12-10
  - `Originating Amount`: 47111
  - `Originator Account Number`: 174-404196-868
  - `Beneficiary Account Number`: 102-659333-750
  - `Originator Name`: (empty)
  - `Beneficiary Name`: HUI TAI MAN
  - `Transaction Code Description`: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL

#### Transaction 2: HKD 47111 on 2024-12-11
- **Exact Match**: Found in CSV with `Transaction ID`: `dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda`
- **Details**:
  - `Transaction Date`: 2024-12-11
  - `Originating Amount`: 47111
  - `Originator Account Number`: 174-404196-868
  - `Beneficiary Account Number`: 439-575754-730
  - `Originator Name`: TSE HOK MING
  - `Beneficiary Name`: AU YEUNG TAI MING
  - `Transaction Code Description`: ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

#### Transaction 1: HKD 47111 on 2024-12-10
- **Transaction References**: `[""6a957023-8798-4cf5-9b6d-d0bd6fbf0c66""]`
- **Fields**:
  - `date`: 2024-12-10
  - `amount`: 47111
  - `currency`: HKD
  - `from`:
    - `name`: (empty)
    - `account_number`: 174-404196-868
    - `bank`: HASE
  - `to`:
    - `name`: HUI TAI MAN
    - `account_number`: 102-659333-750
    - `bank`: (empty)
  - `channel`: ATM
  - `can_be_located`: true

#### Transaction 2: HKD 47111 on 2024-12-11
- **Transaction References**: `[""dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda""]`
- **Fields**:
  - `date`: 2024-12-11
  - `amount`: 47111
  - `currency`: HKD
  - `from`:
    - `name`: TSE HOK MING
    - `account_number`: 174-404196-868
    - `bank`: HASE
  - `to`:
    - `name`: AU YEUNG TAI MING
    - `account_number`: 439-575754-730
    - `bank`: (empty)
  - `channel`: ATM
  - `can_be_located`: true

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- **Fraud Type**: The fraud type is ""Others"". Since there are no specific hints in the document, we will use ""Impersonation"".

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- **Bank Rules**:
  - For both transactions, the originator bank is HASE.
  - Beneficiary bank is not specified in the CSV, so it remains empty.

- **Channel Rules**:
  - Both transactions involve ATM transfers.

### Step 6: Build Final JSON
