ADCC,7,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS 7■■■■■■ and NTKDIV 24■■■■■ (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,8,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

","Dear HSB,

Please be informed of a case of **""Social Media Deception""** reported on **2024-10-07** and it is under the investigation by **E-HUB-■■■**. It is alleged that the relevant crime proceeds were transferred to the account(s) below **[from the victim / from a suspicious account, which had received crime proceeds directly from the victim]**

As a matter of urgency, please inform the ADCC of the following:
i) The latest balance of the beneficiary account(s);
ii) Whether the beneficiary account(s) has been suspended after your review. If yes, what functions are blocked;
Details of Beneficiary

\*\*NO STR\*\*

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **ESPS ■■■■/2024 and ERC24100■■■■■■■■ (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

HSBC Referral,5,5,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,5,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,25,25,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Extracted transactions:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2024-08-28 | 50000  | NA CASH                      |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For the transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction

Match found: 
- Date: 2024-08-28
- Amount: 50000
- Beneficiary Name: MR CHUNG SIU
- Beneficiary Account Number: 111-111111-102

Transaction ID: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Transaction ID: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6

- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
  - 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
  - from.name: MR CHUNG SIU
  - from.account_number: 111-111111-102
  - from.bank: null
  - to.name: MR CHUNG SIU
  - to.account_number: 111-111111-102
  - to.bank: HASE
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
  - date: 2024-08-28
  - amount: 50000
  - currency: HKD
  - channel: cash

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- to.bank: HASE
- channel: cash

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

- Extract the full police reference from the source document
  - TSW RN 240■■■■■■■
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field
  - District Investigation Team 3, Yuen Long District

Police Letter,9,9,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Police Letter,11,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,12,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""police_reference"": ""string | null"", 
  ""police_team"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

Police Letter,12,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2024-07-15 | 40000  | CASH CASH                    |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For the transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

Matched transaction:
- Date: 2024-07-15
- Amount: 40000
- Transaction ID: 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
- Can be located: true
- Transaction references: [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

Merged transaction data:
- Date: 2024-07-15
- Amount: 40000
- Currency: HKD
- From: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: null
  - bank: null

- Channel: cash
- Can be located: true
- Transaction references: [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

Merged transaction data after applying transaction rules:
- Date: 2024-07-15

- Transaction references: [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

Search Warrant,7,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

No transactions are explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount. However, the search warrant mentions that the investigation is related to an offence of ""Obtaining Property By Deception"" and the police are seeking transaction records from a specific bank account (111-111111-102). 

Since no transactions are directly mentioned, we will proceed with extracting the account number and other relevant information for potential matching in the next steps.

Account Number: 111-111111-102
Bank: HASE
Originator Name: CHEUNG TAK SHING
Beneficiary Name: CHUNG SIU

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
No exact matches are found for the extracted transaction in the CSV file. 

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
Since no exact matches were found, we will set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: [] for the transaction.

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
No transactions were matched, so no rules need to be applied.

- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

Transaction 2024-11-08 25900:
- Transaction ID: c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21
- From:
  - name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - account_number: 333-333333-101
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- To:
  - name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - account_number: 111-111111-101
  - bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS
- Can be located: true
- Transaction references: [c348a28c-7710-4c42-9305-ab33cd935d21]

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

Transaction 2024-11-08 25900:
- From:
  - name: CHAN TAI MAN
  - account_number: 333-333333-101
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- To:
  - name: MR CHAN TAI MAN
  - account_number: 111-111111-101
  - bank: HASE
- Channel: FPS

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Transaction 2024-11-08 25900:
- Channel: FPS

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

fraud_type: Obtaining Property By Deception

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

police_reference: TSWRN240■■■■

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

police_team: District Technology and Financial Crime Squad 1 of Yuen Long District

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

UAR,2,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

UAR,3,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,5,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

UAR,5,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

UAR,8,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

}","**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field.

From the FRAUD_ALERT_SOURCE, the following transaction is mentioned:
- Date: Not provided
- Amount: HKD 130000

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

The transaction extracted in Step 1 does not have a date, so it cannot be matched to the CSV.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
Since no transaction was matched, there is no data to merge.

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

The fraud_type is ""External Fraud"".

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHONGA""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

There is no bank information for the transaction.

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

There is no transaction code description or transaction source to apply the rules.

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

There is no cancellation amount specified.

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,25,25,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ODFT,12,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ADCC,307,7,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **C RN 3547 (DIT2-■■■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

ADCC,308,8,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

We have examined each report referred by the subject investigation team and we believe that **that the beneficiary account(s) might have been used to deal with suspected proceeds of crime**. Therefore, you are advised (i) **to critically examine the alleged transaction(s) in the relevant account(s)** to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account(s) is legitimate and (ii) **to actively consider appropriate actions** to avoid dealing with property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represent any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, which may be liable to a prosecution for a criminal offence under sections 25(1) and (3) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455. A person includes a financial institution.

When fulfilling the reporting obligations by filing Suspicious Transaction Reports (STR) to the Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (""JFIU""), if any, please state **STRN4150 (E-HUB-■■■)** for ease of reference.

We confirm that the requested information is required for the purpose of section 58(1)(a) under the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap 486. Failure to provide the requested information may lead to possibly failure or unnecessary delay on prevention or detection of crime. In view of the above, we consider that section 58(2) as read with section 58(1)(a) of the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, Cap. 486 is the applicable exemption under the circumstances.

You are also advised to refer to the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO"") and to take all reasonable measures to prevent a contravention and to mitigate Money Laundering risks.

}","**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field.

- Date: 2024-01-20
- Amount: 114104 HKD

Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields.

- Date: 2024-01-20
- Amount: 114104
- Currency: HKD
- Remitting Bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong)
- AC Location: Hong Kong
- Depositor AC No.: 59407816184
- Depositor AC Name: ZHAO WEI HONG

Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content.

- Date: 2024-01-20
- Amount: 114104
- Currency: HKD
- Remitting Bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong)
- AC Location: Hong Kong
- Depositor AC No.: 59407816184
- Depositor AC Name: ZHAO WEI HONG

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

- Date: 2024-01-20
- Amount: 114104
- Beneficiary Account Number: 949-759176-733
- Beneficiary Name: TANG SIU KWAN

Exact match found in CSV:

- Transaction ID: 9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff

Use that single Transaction ID.

- can_be_located: true
- transaction_references: [9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff]

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Extract transaction_references from CSV.

- transaction_references: [9ccba1a1-5b79-4c26-adb5-321e79343bff]

Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"").

- from: 
  - name: ZHAO WEI HONG
  - account_number: 59407816184
  - bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- to: 
  - name: TANG SIU KWAN
  - account_number: 949-759176-733
  - bank: HASE

Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values.

- date: 2024-01-20
- amount: 114104
- currency: HKD

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

Apply Cash Transaction Rules.

- No originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"".

Apply Bank Rules.

- from.bank: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited
- to.bank: HASE

Apply Channel Rules.

- Transaction Code Description: CWTF
- Transaction Type Source: Default transaction
- Sending Bank Account Number: Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited    HK
- Channel: FPS

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

Extract the full police reference from the source document.

- police_reference: STRN4150

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,4,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,5,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,6,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1805,5,9,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

HSBC Referral,1807,7,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Always ""HSBC""
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2552,2,2,"[1, 2]","You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case DSIP LAM ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For the transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction

Match found for the transaction:

Transaction ID: 3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6
- Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV: [3e024257-694b-4138-bb70-c8e9082160d6]
- Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case Inspector HO ■■■ ■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**

Police Letter,2561,11,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

Police Letter,2562,12,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Police Letter,2562,12,3,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the ""Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)"" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 (""AMLO""), which states that:-

*""An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]"".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*""Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. "" (section 25(1))*

*\""Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\"" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

}","**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
Extracted transactions:

| Date       | Amount | Transferor's Bank and Account |
|------------|--------|------------------------------|
| 2023-09-20 | 27947  | CASH CASH                    |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For the transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

Matched transaction:
- Date: 2023-09-20
- Amount: 27947
- Transaction ID: 798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106
- Can be located: true
- Transaction references: [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

Merged transaction data:
- Date: 2023-09-20
- Amount: 27947
- Currency: HKD
- From: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: null
  - bank: null
- To:

  - account_number: 549-818437-223

- Channel: cash
- Can be located: true
- Transaction references: [798d401c-512f-4779-8a01-a46353179106]

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Cash Transaction Rules:**
- If originator bank or name contains ""cash"" or ""cash deposit"":
  * Set channel to ""cash""
  * Set from.bank to null
  * Set from.name to null (if it was the cash reference)

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

Search Warrant,3306,6,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}","Based on the provided documents and CSV, I will follow the step-by-step process to extract transactions, match them to the CSV records, and produce the consolidated JSON output.

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the fraud alert source, I extracted the following transactions:

- No specific transactions are mentioned in the source. However, it mentions two bank account numbers: 111-111111-101 and 333-333333-101. These can be considered as potential transactions to be matched with the CSV records.

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Since no specific transactions are mentioned, I will consider the two account numbers as potential transactions to be matched with the CSV records.

- For account number 111-111111-101:
  - No exact match found in the CSV records.
  - Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

- For account number 333-333333-101:
  - No exact match found in the CSV records.
  - Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since no transactions were matched, there is no data to merge.

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**

- from.bank:
  - For account number 111-111111-101: null
  - For account number 333-333333-101: null

- to.bank:
  - Always ""HASE""

- Channel Rules:
  - No transactions were matched, so the channel field will be null for both accounts.

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**

- Fraud Type Rules:
  - The fraud_type is ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", which is an offence type. Looking for other fraud type hints in the document, I found ""Obtaining Property By Deception, contrary to Section 17 (1 ) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap. 210"". I will use this as the fraud_type.

- Police Reference Rules:
  - The police_reference is ""HH RN 4568"".

- Police Team Rules:
  - The police_team is ""District Technology and Financial Crime Squad, Kwun Tong District, Hong Kong Police Force"".

- Writ No.:
  - The writ_no is ""0118099"".

- Contact Person:
  - The contact_person is ""PC7660"".

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Here is the final JSON output:

Search Warrant,3307,7,3,2,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 5: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is an offence type such as ""Obtaining Property By Deception"", ""Dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence"" and ""Fraud, Contrary to Section 16 (A) of the Theft Ordinance, Cap.134, Laws of Hong Kong"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Police Reference Rules:**
- Extract the full police reference from the source document
- Exclude police team information that starts with ""(DIT"" or ""(E-HUB"" from the police_reference field

**Police Team Rules:**
- Extract police team information including district and police station if available
- Include full team designation with district/station information

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global fields (fraud_type, police_reference, writ_no, contact_person, police_team): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}","**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
No transactions are explicitly mentioned in the fraud alert source with both date and amount. However, the search warrant mentions that the police are seeking the transaction record from opening date to present for the account 111-111111-102. We will assume that this is the only transaction of interest and extract it.

**Transaction:**
- date: 2024-10-22 (the date of the search warrant)
- amount: null
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: null
  - bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- to: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: 111-111111-102
  - bank: HASE

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
No exact match is found for the extracted transaction in the CSV file.

**Transaction:**
- date: 2024-10-22
- amount: null
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: null

  - account_number: 111-111111-102
  - bank: HASE
- can_be_located: false
- transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
No data is merged for this transaction as no match was found in the CSV file.

**Transaction:**
- date: 2024-10-22
- amount: null
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: null
  - bank: Hang Seng Bank Ltd.
- to: 
  - name: null
  - account_number: 111-111111-102
  - bank: HASE
- can_be_located: false
- transaction_references: []

**Step 4: Apply Transaction Rules**
No bank name is directly mentioned in the source file, so we will apply the previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual.

**Transaction:**
- date: 2024-10-22
- amount: null
- currency: HKD
- from:

UAR,4302,2,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

UAR,4303,3,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

    }
  ]
}","Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field. Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields. Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content.

Transaction 1:
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 26830
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 326-186461-555
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 382-657343-701
  - bank: HASE

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

Transaction 1:
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 26830
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 326-186461-555
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 382-657343-701
  - bank: HASE
- exact match found in CSV: 1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03
- can_be_located: true
- transaction_references: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
Use null if neither source has the value

Transaction 1:
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 26830
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 326-186461-555
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 382-657343-701
  - bank: HASE
- transaction_references: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]
- from.name: LAM HOI SHAN
- from.account_number: 326-186461-555
- from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to.name: LAM HOI SHAN
- to.account_number: 382-657343-701
- to.bank: HASE
- channel: FPS

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

Apply these rules when populating global fields:

Fraud Type Rules:
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

fraud_type: External Fraud

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

Bank Rules:
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

Transaction 1:
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 26830
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 326-186461-555
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: LAM HOI SHAN
  - account_number: 382-657343-701
  - bank: HASE
- transaction_references: [1fd9e993-bbbb-44ca-ba74-56f5359e0e03]
- from.name: LAM HOI SHAN
- from.account_number: 326-186461-555
- from.bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to.name: LAM HOI SHAN
- to.account_number: 382-657343-701

UAR,4305,5,7,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

}","Based on the provided documents, I will follow the step-by-step process to extract transactions, match them to CSV records, and produce a consolidated JSON output.

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field. Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields. Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content.

Transaction 1:
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 39938
- currency: HKD
- from: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 467-941316-646
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 916-632151-107
  - bank: HASE

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

Transaction 1:
- exact match found: 
  - date: 2024-11-12
  - amount: 39938
  - from: 
    - name: MOK SIU YING
    - account_number: 467-941316-646
    - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
  - to: 
    - name: MOK SIU YING
    - account_number: 916-632151-107
    - bank: HASE
  - Transaction ID: c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
Use null if neither source has the value

Transaction 1:
- transaction_references: [c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432]
- from: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 467-941316-646
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 916-632151-107
  - bank: HASE
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 39938
- currency: HKD

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

fraud_type: External Fraud

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

Bank Rules:
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank: Always ""HASE""

Transaction 1:
- from: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 467-941316-646
  - bank: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited
- to: 
  - name: MOK SIU YING
  - account_number: 916-632151-107
  - bank: HASE
- date: 2024-11-12
- amount: 39938
- currency: HKD
- channel: FPS
- can_be_located: true
- transaction_references: [c4ae19d2-61c0-443e-9dfe-c007ddaf6432]
- cancel_amount_requested: 20000

UAR,4305,5,8,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:

      ],
      ""cancel_amount_requested"": 2353
    }
  ]
}","Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field:

| date       | amount | currency | originator_name | beneficiary_name | transaction_description |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| 2024-11-11 | 2353.49 | HKD     | WONG KA MING    | WONG KA MING     | Default transaction    |

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

| date       | amount | currency | originator_name | beneficiary_name | transaction_description | can_be_located | transaction_references |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 2024-11-11 | 2353.49 | HKD     | WONG KA MING    | WONG KA MING     | Default transaction    | true            | 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7 |

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

| date       | amount | currency | from.name | from.account_number | from.bank | to.name | to.account_number | to.bank | channel | can_be_located | transaction_references | cancel_amount_requested |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|---------|------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 2024-11-11 | 2353.49 | HKD     | WONG KA MING    | 542-170681-918    | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | WONG KA MING | 969-984363-416 | HASE    | FPS      | true            | 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7 | 2353.49 |

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

| fraud_type |
|------------|
| External Fraud |

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

| date       | amount | currency | from.name | from.account_number | from.bank | to.name | to.account_number | to.bank | channel | can_be_located | transaction_references | cancel_amount_requested | fraud_type |
|------------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------------|-----------|---------|------------------|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------|
| 2024-11-11 | 2353.49 | HKD     | WONG KA MING    | 542-170681-918    | The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited | WONG KA MING | 969-984363-416 | HASE    | FPS      | true            | 47bf0cc4-cbc9-4dde-ab99-3a8e4d40d5e7 | 2353.49 | External Fraud |

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules

UAR,4308,8,2,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

JSON Schema:
{
  ""fraud_type"": ""string | null"",
  ""alerted_transactions"": [

}","Based on the provided documents, I will follow the step-by-step process to extract transactions, match them to the CSV records, and produce the consolidated JSON output.

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**

From the FRAUD_ALERT_SOURCE, the reported transaction is:

- Date: Not provided
- Amount: HKD 130000

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

Since the date is not provided, I will not proceed with the matching process. However, I will note that the amount is HKD 130000.

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

Since no match was found, I will set can_be_located to false and transaction_references to an empty array.

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

The fraud_type is ""External Fraud"".

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

- from.bank: Not applicable since no match was found.
- to.bank: ""HASE""
- channel: Not applicable since no match was found.
- The other fields will be set to null.

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**

Here is the final JSON output:

```json

UAR,4313,13,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * First identify the bank from source file using the following mapping:
    - HSBCHKHH/004 BBAN/BBAN 4 -> ""HSBC""
    - SCBLHKHH/003 BBAN/BBAN 3 -> ""STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (HONG KONG) LIMITED""  
    - PCBCHKHH/PCBCCNBJ/009 BBAN/BBAN 9 -> ""CCBA""
    - BKCHHKHH/012 BBAN/BBAN 12 -> ""BOC""
    - DBSSHKHH/016 BBAN/BBAN 16 -> ""DBS""
    - HASEHKHH/024 BBAN/BBAN 24 -> ""HASE""
    - UBHKHKHH/ICBKCNBJ/072 BBAN/BBAN 72 -> ""INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL BANK OF CHINA""
    - 387 BBAN -> ""ZA Bank Limited""
  * If bank name is directly mentioned in source file, use that bank name as-is
  * Then apply previous matching and merging rules from CSV data as usual
- to.bank:
  * Always ""HASE""

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

From the FRAUD_ALERT_SOURCE, I extracted the following transaction:

- date: 2024-08-21
- amount: 1651
- currency: HKD

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**

I searched for an exact match in the TRANSACTION_RECORDS_CSV. The transaction was found with the following match:

- date: 2024-08-21
- amount: 1651
- currency: HKD
- originator account/name: TSANG MEI LIN/TSANG MEI LIN

I used the Transaction ID: 840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**

I extracted the transaction references from the CSV:

- transaction_references: [840c69f6-b9ea-494f-85b8-3a2920de7719]

I used the CSV values for all transaction fields:

- from:
  - name: TSANG MEI LIN
  - account_number: 723-330881-476
  - bank: HSBCHKHH/004 (mapped to ""HSBC"")
- to:
  - name: HO WING KEI
  - account_number: 819-444432-808
  - bank: HASE

I filled missing fields with the fraud alert source values:

- date: 2024-08-21
- amount: 1651
- currency: HKD
- channel: ATM

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**

I applied the global field rules:

- fraud_type: External Fraud (from FRAUD_ALERT_SOURCE)

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**

I applied the transaction rules:

- from.bank: HSBC

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Special Handling for cancel_amount_requested (Per Transaction):**
For each transaction:
- If the fraud alert source specifies a cancellation amount, set cancel_amount_requested to that value for the transaction
- If no amount is specified but a cancellation is requested, assume a full cancellation of the payment for the transaction
- If no cancellation is requested for the transaction, set cancel_amount_requested to null

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied

ODFT,5062,12,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

ODFT,5070,20,1,1,"You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in data extraction and record linkage. You will be provided with a fraud alert source and a CSV file of transaction records.

Your task: Extract transactions from the fraud alert source, match them to CSV records, and produce consolidated JSON output using a step-by-step approach.

Step-by-Step Process:

**Step 1: Extract Reported Transactions from Source**
- Extract all transactions explicitly mentioned with both date and amount and exclude transactions missing either field
- Preserve each transaction exactly as reported in the source and preserve all required fields
- Trim leading and trailing whitespace from each extracted field value, but do not alter internal whitespace or any other content
- Only proceed to Step 2 after completing this extraction

**Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV**
For each transaction extracted in Step 1:
- First, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)
- If exact match found: Use that single Transaction ID
- Do not repeat selecting the same transaction - each CSV transaction can only be used once
- Even if multiple CSV transactions match the criteria, always select only one transaction
- If no exact date match found: Search for transactions with **previous dates** (earlier than the reported transaction date) using same amount + account/name match criteria, prioritizing the closest previous date
- If still no match found: Set can_be_located: false and transaction_references: []

**Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction**
- First: Extract transaction_references (Transaction IDs) from CSV
- Then: Use CSV values for all transaction fields (originator becomes ""from"", beneficiary becomes ""to"")
- Finally: Fill missing fields with fraud alert source values
- Use null if neither source has the value

**Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules**
Apply these rules when populating global fields:

**Fraud Type Rules:**
- If fraud_type is ""Others"", ""Money Laundering"" or ""External Fraud"": Look for other fraud type hints in the document and use those instead, otherwise return ""Not provided""
- Otherwise: Use the fraud_type value from fraud alert source

**Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules**
Apply these rules when populating transaction fields:

**Bank Rules:**
- from.bank:
  * Victim ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Suspect ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source
- to.bank:
  * Suspect ODFT: Always ""HASE""
  * Victim ODFT: Determine from the CSV data or fraud alert source

**IMPORTANT: Bank Code Distinctions:**
- HSB or HASE = Hang Seng Bank Ltd. (these are the SAME bank)
- HSBC = The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (this is a DIFFERENT bank from HSB/HASE)
- Do NOT confuse HSB with HSBC - they are completely different banks

**Channel Rules (Payment Method):**
The channel field can only be: ""FPS"", ""cash"", ""ATM"", ""cash deposits via ATM"", ""Branch"", or null

Based on Transaction Code Description in CSV:
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED DEPOSIT"" → ""ATM""
- ""ATM TRANSFER UNRELATED WITHDRAWAL"" → ""ATM""
- ""CASH DEP VIA CDM/BCDM - AC INPUT (TOUCH SCREEN)"" → ""cash""
- ""ATM/CDM CASH CREDIT USINGACCOUNT INPUT"" → ""cash deposits via ATM"" if source file mentions ATM, otherwise ""cash""
- ""CIF CASH DEPOSIT"" → ""cash""

Based on Transaction Source in CSV:
- ""CMTF"" → ""Branch""
- ""CWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""DWTF"" → ""FPS""
- ""FPWICT"" → ""FPS""

**Step 6: Build Final JSON**
- Global field (fraud_type): Use fraud alert source with global field rules applied
- Include all transactions extracted from source, each matched to CSV records, enriched with merged data, and adjusted by transaction rules
- Ensure the final JSON output strictly follows the schema and includes all required fields

| 2024-12-11 | 47111  |

### Step 2: Match Each Reported Transaction to CSV

For each transaction extracted in Step 1, search for exact match: same date + same amount + (originator account/name OR beneficiary account/name match)

  - can_be_located: true
  - transaction_references: [dfc3902b-ad86-42bb-a146-4e8a32e58eda]

### Step 3: Merge Data for Each Matched Transaction

  - to: { name: null, account_number: '102-659333-750', bank: 'HASE' }
  - channel: 'ATM'
  - date: '2024-12-10'
  - amount: 47111
  - currency: 'HKD'

  - channel: 'ATM'
  - date: '2024-12-11'
  - amount: 47111
  - currency: 'HKD'

### Step 4: Apply Global Field Rules

- fraud_type: Impersonation

### Step 5: Apply Transaction Rules

- 2024-12-10: 
  - from.bank: null
  - to.bank: 'HASE'
- 2024-12-11: 
  - from.bank: 'HASE'
  - to.bank: 'HASE'

- 2024-12-10: 
  - channel: 'ATM'
