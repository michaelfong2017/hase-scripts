<tr><th colspan='3'>Case Summary:</th></tr><tr><td colspan='3'>A/D/T/L, VTM received a phone call from WP, who purported to be a staff of "CSL". WP claimed that VTM had registered a "CSL" SIM card and a monthly fee of HK$298 will be charged from his bank account automatically for two years (total charge HK$7,152). VTM denied making the registration
and requested for cancellation. WP offered to cancel the registration and
requested VTM to transfer HK$5,000 as guarantee money. WP claimed that
the money would be refunded to VTM later. Believing so, VTM transferred
HK$5,000 (S/Ppty) via ATM transfer to WP's bank account as instructed. WP
eventually became out of reach and VTM did not receive the promised
refund. Case was reported. VTM could not provide WP's account number at
this stage as WP only provided the number during phone call</td></tr>

I suggest that you examine the above/past transactions in the above account to ascertain whether or not you are satisfied that the provenance of the deposits into the said account is legitimate.

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to chapter 3.1 of the "Guideline on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter- Financing of Terrorism (for Authorized Institutions)" published by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under section 7 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, Cap. 615 ("AMLO"), which states that:-

*"An Authorized Institution should take all reasonable measures to ensure that proper safeguards exist to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing and to prevent a contravention of any requirement under Part 2 or 3 of Schedule 2 [to the AMLO]".*

May I also remind you of sections 25(1) and 25A(1) of the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, Cap. 455, Laws of Hong Kong, which state that:-

*"Subject to section 25A, a person commits an offence if, knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that any property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence, he deals with that property. " (section 25(1))*

*\"Where a person knows or suspects that any property:-
(a) in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of;
(b) was used in connection with; or
(c) is intended to be used in connection with,
an indictable offence, he shall as soon as it is reasonable for him to do so disclose that knowledge or suspicion, together with any matter on which that knowledge or suspicion is based, to an authorized officer.\" (section 25A(1))*

Please treat this notification in confidence. Disclosure of the contents of this notification, directly or indirectly, to any unauthorized persons including the subjects under investigation, may prejudice the police investigation.

Should you have any queries concerning this matter, please contact the Officer-in-Charge of the case YUEN ■■■■■■■ on telephone number 366■■■■■

Yours faithfully,
